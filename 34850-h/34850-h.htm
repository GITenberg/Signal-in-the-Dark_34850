<br /><i>HELP WANTED</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The situation is getting worse instead of
better, Penny. Three of our reporters are sick, and
we&rsquo;re trying to run the paper with only a third of our
normal editorial staff.&rdquo; Anthony Parker, publisher of
the <i>Riverview Star</i>, whirled around in the swivel chair
to face his daughter who sat opposite him in the
private office of the newspaper. &ldquo;Frankly, I&rsquo;m up
against it,&rdquo; he added gloomily.</p>
<p>Penny, a slim girl with deep, intelligent blue eyes,
uncurled herself from the window ledge. Carefully,
she dusted her brown wool skirt which had picked up
a cobweb and streaks of dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could use a janitor around here too,&rdquo; she
hinted teasingly. &ldquo;How about hiring me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As queen of the dustmop brigade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a reporter,&rdquo; Penny corrected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious,
Dad. You&rsquo;re desperate for employes. I&rsquo;m desperate
for spending money. I have three weeks school vacation
coming up, so why not strike a bargain?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The paper needs experienced workers, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very good writer,&rdquo; Mr. Parker admitted.
&ldquo;In fact, in months past you turned in some of the best
feature stories the <i>Star</i> ever printed. But always they
were special assignments. We must have a reporter
who can work a daily, eight-hour grind and be depended
upon to handle routine stories with speed,
accuracy and efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think I am not what the doctor ordered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Parker, &ldquo;that you would
blow your pretty little top by the end of the second
day. For instance, it&rsquo;s not easy nor pleasant to write
obituaries. Yet it must be done, and accurately. On
this paper, a new reporter is expected to do rewrites
and other tedious work. You wouldn&rsquo;t like it,
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take it neatly in my stride, Dad. Why not try
me and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker shook his head and began to read the
three-star edition of the paper, its ink still damp from
the press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me one sound, logical reason for turning me
down,&rdquo; Penny persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. You are my daughter. Our editors
might feel that they were compelled to treat you with
special consideration&mdash;give you the best assignments&mdash;handle
you with kid gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You could take care of that matter easily enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they took my instructions seriously, you might
not like it,&rdquo; the newspaper owner warned. &ldquo;A reporter
learns hard and bitter lessons. Mr. DeWitt, for
instance, is a fine editor&mdash;our best, but he has a temper
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frosted glass door swung open and an elderly,
slightly bald man in shirt sleeves slouched in. Seeing
Penny, he would have retreated, had not Mr. Parker
called him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind, DeWitt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; growled the editor. &ldquo;That no-good,
addle-brained boy we hired as night police reporter,
just blew up! Said it was too confining to sit in a
police station all night waiting for something to happen!
So he gets himself a job in a canning factory!
Now we&rsquo;re another employee short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, let me take over the night police job!&rdquo; Penny
pleaded.</p>
<p>Both her father and Mr. DeWitt smiled as if suffering
from intense pain. &ldquo;Penny,&rdquo; Mr. Parker explained
gently. &ldquo;Night police work isn&rsquo;t suitable for
a girl. Furthermore, it is one of the most undesirable
jobs on a paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to work somewhere, and you&rsquo;re so
stubborn!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Mr. DeWitt studied Penny with concentrated interest.
Hope flickered in his eyes. Turning abruptly to
Mr. Parker he asked: &ldquo;Why not, Chief? We could
use her on the desk for rewrite. We&rsquo;re mighty hard
up, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the personnel problem?&rdquo; Mr. Parker
frowned. &ldquo;How would the staff take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the reporters might not like it,&rdquo; Mr.
DeWitt admitted, &ldquo;but who&rsquo;s running this paper anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I often wonder,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>Detecting signs of a weakening, Penny appealed to
Mr. DeWitt. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I be a help to you if I were
on the staff?&rdquo; she urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sure,&rdquo; he agreed cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you see, Dad! Mr. DeWitt wants me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, it&rsquo;s a personnel problem,&rdquo; her father explained
with growing impatience. &ldquo;The other reporters
might not consider you a welcome addition
to the staff. You would expect favors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need her,&rdquo; said Mr. DeWitt significantly.
&ldquo;We really do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With two against him, Mr. Parker suddenly gave in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Penny, we&rsquo;ll put you on
as a cub reporter. That means you&rsquo;ll start as a beginner
with a beginner&rsquo;s salary and do routine work
until you&rsquo;ve proved your merit. You&rsquo;ll expect no
special consideration. Is that understood?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly!&rdquo; Grinning from ear to ear, Penny
would have agreed to anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, if the work gets you down, I won&rsquo;t
have you coming to me asking for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never darken your office door, Dad. Just one
question. How much money does a beginner get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s face was a blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be more than you are worth the first few
weeks,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; Penny declared hastily. &ldquo;When do I
start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; decided her father. &ldquo;DeWitt, introduce
her to the staff, and put her to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling highly elated but a trifle self-conscious,
Penny followed Editor DeWitt past the photography
studio and the A.P. wire room to the main newsroom
where reporters were tapping at their typewriters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gang,&rdquo; said Mr. DeWitt in an all inclusive introduction.
&ldquo;This is Penny Parker. She&rsquo;ll be working
here for a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heads lifted and appraising eyes focused upon her.
Nearly everyone nodded and smiled, but one girl who
sat at the far end of a long typewriter table regarded
her with an intent, almost hostile stare. And as luck
would have it, Mr. DeWitt assigned Penny to the
typewriter adjoining hers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is Elda Hunt,&rdquo; he introduced her. &ldquo;Show
Penny the ropes, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, a blonde, with heavily-rouged cheeks,
patted the rigid rolls of her hair into place. Staring
at Mr. DeWitt, she answered not a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a lot to learn,&rdquo; Penny said, trying to make
friendly conversation.</p>
<p>Elda shrugged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the publisher&rsquo;s daughter,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll have too hard a time,&rdquo;
the girl drawled.</p>
<p>Penny started to reply, but thought better of it.
Seating herself beside Elda, she unhooded the typewriter,
rolled a sheet of copy paper into it, and experimented
with the keys.</p>
<p>The main newsroom was a confusion of sound.
Although work was being handled with dispatch,
there was an air of tension, for press time on the five-star
edition was drawing close. Telephones were
ringing, and Editor DeWitt, who sat at the head of
the big rectangular desk, tersely assigned reporters
to take the incoming calls. Not far from Penny&rsquo;s ear,
the police shortwave radio blared. Copy boys ran to
and fro.</p>
<p>Benny Jewell, the assistant editor, tossed her a handful
of typewritten sheets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take these handouts and make &rsquo;em into shorts,&rdquo;
he instructed briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handouts?&rdquo; Penny asked in bewilderment.
&ldquo;Shorts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the stories to a paragraph or two each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Penny, catching on. &ldquo;You want me to
rewrite them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At her elbow, Elda openly snickered.</p>
<p>Color stained Penny&rsquo;s cheeks, but she quietly read
the first sheet, which was an account of a meeting to
be held the following week. Picking out the most
important facts, she boiled the story down to two
short paragraphs, and dropped the finished copy into
the editor&rsquo;s wire basket.</p>
<p>Only then did Elda speak. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to
make two carbons of every story you write,&rdquo; she said
pityingly.</p>
<p>The girl might have told her sooner, Penny thought.
However, she thanked her politely, and finding carbon
paper, rewrote the story. In her nervousness she
inserted one of the carbons upside down, ruining the
impression. As she removed the sheets from the
machine, she saw what she had done. Elda saw too,
and smiled in a superior way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She dislikes me intensely,&rdquo; Penny thought. &ldquo;I
wonder why? I&rsquo;ve not done a thing to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Aware that she had wasted paper and valuable time,
Penny recopied the story a third time and turned it in
to the editor. After that, she rewrote the additional
stories with fairly good speed. By watching other
reporters she learned that the carbon copies were
speared on spindles which at intervals a copy boy
collected and carried away.</p>
<p>A telephone rang, and this time, Mr. DeWitt, looking
straight at Penny, said: &ldquo;An obituary. Will you
take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to the phone and copied down the facts
carefully, knowing that while death notices were routine,
they were of vital interest to readers of the paper.
Any mistake of fact could prove serious.</p>
<p>Returning to her typewriter, she wrote the item.
But after she had turned it in, Mr. DeWitt called her
to his desk. He was pleasant but firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day are services to be held?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Who are the survivors? Where did the woman die?
Furthermore, we never use the word &lsquo;Funeral Home&rsquo;.
Instead, we say &lsquo;mortuary&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny telephoned for more information, and finally
after rewriting the notice twice more, succeeded in
getting it past Mr. DeWitt. But as he tossed the story
to a copy reader, she saw that he had pencilled several
changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to writing routine stories than I
thought,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll really have to dig in unless
I want to disgrace Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Penny was given another obituary to write which
proved nearly as difficult as the first. Hopelessly discouraged,
she started for the rest room to get a drink
and wash her hands.</p>
<p>As she entered the lounge, voices reached her ears,
and instantly she realized that Elda Hunt was talking
to another girl reporter about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The publisher&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo; she heard her say
scathingly. &ldquo;As if we aren&rsquo;t having a hard enough
time here, without having to coddle her along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think she seemed so bad,&rdquo; the other replied.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll catch on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be promoted over all our heads if that&rsquo;s what
you mean!&rdquo; Elda retorted bitterly. &ldquo;I know for a fact,
she&rsquo;s starting at fifty a week, and no experience! If
you ask me, it&rsquo;s unfair! We should walk out of here,
and see how those fine editors would like that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">2</span>
<br /><i>EXPLOSION!</i></h2>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s first thought was to accost the two girls
and correct the misstatements. But sober reflection
convinced her she could make no graver mistake. Far
better, she reasoned, to ignore the entire matter.</p>
<p>She quickly washed her hands, purposely making
enough noise to draw attention to her presence. Elda
and her friend became silent. A moment later, coming
through the inner door of the powder room, they
saw her, but offered no comment. Penny hastily returned
to the newsroom.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the day she worked with deep
concentration, only dimly aware of what went on
about her. Seemingly there were endless numbers of
obituaries to write. Telephones rang constantly.
Work was never finished, for as soon as one edition
was off the press, another was in the making.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Now and then Penny caught herself glancing toward
an empty desk at the far corner of the room.
Jerry Livingston had sat there until a year ago when
he had been granted a leave of absence to join the
Army Air Force. Unquestionably the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> most
talented reporter, he had been Penny&rsquo;s best friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Jerry were here,&rdquo; she thought wistfully.
&ldquo;But if he were, he&rsquo;d tell me to buckle down and not
let this job lick me! Dad warned me it would be hard,
monotonous work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny worked with renewed energy. After awhile
she began to feel that she was making definite progress.
Mr. Jewell, the assistant editor, made fewer corrections
as he read over her copy, and now and then she
actually saw him nod approvingly. Once when she
turned in a rewritten &ldquo;hand-out&rdquo;&mdash;a publicity story
which had been sent to the paper in unusable form&mdash;he
praised her for giving it a fresh touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lead,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming
along all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elda heard the praise and her eyes snapped angrily.
At her typewriter, she slammed the carriage. No one
noticed except Penny. A moment later, Mr. DeWitt
called Elda to his desk, saying severely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch the spelling of names, Elda. This is the third
one we&rsquo;ve checked you on today. Don&rsquo;t you ever
consult the city directory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do!&rdquo; Elda was indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, watch it,&rdquo; Mr. DeWitt said again. &ldquo;We must
have accuracy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>With a swish of skirts, Elda went back to her desk.
Her face was as dark as a thunder cloud. Deliberately
she dawdled over her next piece of copy. After she
had turned it in, she returned to the editor&rsquo;s desk to
take it from the wire basket and make additional corrections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just being extra careful of names,&rdquo; she said arrogantly
as the assistant editor shot her a quick, inquiring
glance.</p>
<p>Thinking no more of the incident, Penny kept on
with her own work. She took special care with
names, even looking up in the city directory those of
which she was almost certain. When she turned in a
piece of copy, she was satisfied that not a name or fact
was inaccurate.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, she noticed that Mr. DeWitt
and Mr. Jewell appeared displeased about a story they
had found in the Five Star edition of the paper. After
reading it, they talked together, and then sorted
through a roll of discarded copy, evidently searching
for the original. Finally, Mr. DeWitt called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondering what she had done wrong, Penny went
quickly to his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote this story?&rdquo; he asked, jabbing a pencil
at one of the printed obituaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged. &ldquo;Is anything
wrong with it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only that you&rsquo;ve buried the wrong man,&rdquo; DeWitt
said sarcastically. &ldquo;Where did you get that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny felt actually sick, and her skin prickled with
heat. She stared at the story in print. It said that
John Gorman had died that morning in Mercy Hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who died was John Borman,&rdquo; DeWitt
said grimly. &ldquo;It happens that John Gorman is one of
the city&rsquo;s most prominent industrialists. We&rsquo;ve made
the correction, but it was too late to catch two-thirds
of the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stared again at the name, her mind working
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. DeWitt,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
I wrote it that way. I knew the correct name was
Borman. I&rsquo;m sure that was how I turned it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you hit a wrong letter on the typewriter,&rdquo;
the editor said less severely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why one always
should read over a story after it&rsquo;s written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did that too,&rdquo; Penny said, and then bit her
lip, because she realized she was arguing about the
matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look at the carbons,&rdquo; decided Mr. DeWitt.</p>
<p>They had been taken from the spindles by copy
boys, but the editor ordered the entire day&rsquo;s work returned
to his desk. Pawing through the sheets, he
came to the one Penny had written. Swiftly he compared
it with the original copy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; he exclaimed in amazement. &ldquo;The
carbons show you wrote the name John Borman, not
Gorman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the copy that was turned into the basket said
John Gorman. Didn&rsquo;t you change it on the first
sheet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I didn&rsquo;t, Mr. DeWitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scowling, the editor compared the two copies. Obviously
on the original sheet, a neat erasure had been
made, and a typewritten letter <i>G</i> had been substituted
for <i>B</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something funny about this,&rdquo; Mr. DeWitt
said. &ldquo;Mighty funny!&rdquo; His gaze roved about the
typewriter table, focusing for an instant upon Elda
who had been listening intently to the conversation.
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he added to Penny. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look into
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, she saw him showing the copy sheets to the
assistant editor. Seemingly, the two men were deeply
puzzled as to how the error had been made. Penny
had her own opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elda did it,&rdquo; she thought resentfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager
she removed the sheet from the wire basket when she
pretended to be making a correction on her own
story!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Having no proof, Penny wisely kept her thoughts to
herself. But she knew that in the future she must take
double precautions to guard against other tricks to
discredit her.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the newsroom rapidly emptied.
One by one, reporters covered their typewriters
and left the building. A few of the girls remained,
among them, Penny and Elda. Editor DeWitt was
putting on his hat when the telephone rang.</p>
<p>Absently he reached for it and then straightened to
alert attention. Grabbing a sheet of copy paper, he
scrawled a few words. Eyes focused upon him, for
instinctively everyone knew that something important
had happened.</p>
<p>DeWitt hung up the receiver, his eyes staring into
space for an instant. Then he seized the telephone
again and called the composing room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold the paper!&rdquo; he ordered tersely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
making over the front page!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news was electrifying, for only a story of the
greatest importance would bring an order to stop the
thundering presses once they had started to roll.</p>
<p>Calling the photography room, DeWitt demanded:
&ldquo;Is Salt Sommers still there? Tell him to grab his
camera and get over to the Conway Steel Plant in
double-quick time! There&rsquo;s been a big explosion!
They think it&rsquo;s sabotage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor&rsquo;s harassed gaze then wandered over the
little group of remaining reporters. Elda pushed toward
the desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to go over there, Chief?&rdquo; she demanded
eagerly.</p>
<p>DeWitt did not appear to hear her. Seizing the
telephone once more, he tried without success to get
two of the men reporters who had left the office only
a few minutes earlier.</p>
<p>Slamming down the receiver, his gloomy gaze focused
upon Elda for an instant. But he passed her by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was beside him in a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride with Salt Sommers to the Conway Plant!&rdquo;
he ordered tersely. &ldquo;Two men have been reported
killed in the explosion! Get everything you can and
hold on until relieved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing hat and purse, Penny made a dash for the
stairway. No need for DeWitt to tell her that this
was a big story! Because all the other reporters except
Elda were gone, she had been given the assignment!
But could she make good?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my chance!&rdquo; she thought jubilantly. &ldquo;DeWitt
probably thinks I&rsquo;ll fold up, but I&rsquo;ll prove to him
I can get the facts as well as one of his seasoned reporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was well acquainted with Salt Sommers, who
next to Jerry Livingston was her best friend. Reaching
the ground floor, she saw his battered car starting
away from the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>The photographer halted and swung open the car
door. She slid in beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, Penny?&rdquo; he demanded,
shifting gears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your little assistant,&rdquo; Penny broke the news
gently. &ldquo;I just started to work on the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And DeWitt assigned you to this story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t help himself. Nearly everyone else
had left the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car whirled around a corner and raced through
a traffic light just as it turned amber. Suddenly from
far away, there came a dull explosion which rocked
the pavement. Salt and Penny stared at each other
with alert comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was at the Conway Plant!&rdquo; the photographer
exclaimed, pushing his foot hard on the gas pedal.
&ldquo;Penny, we&rsquo;ve got a real assignment ahead of us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT</i></h2>
<p>Darkness shrouded the streets as the press
car careened toward the outskirts of the city where
the Conway Steel Plant was situated. Rattling over
the river bridge, Salt and Penny caught their first
glimpse of the factory.</p>
<p>Flames were shooting high into the sky from one
of the buildings, and employes poured in panic
through the main gate. No policemen were yet in
evidence, nor had the fire department arrived.</p>
<p>Pulling up at the curb, Salt seized his camera and
stuffed a handful of flashbulbs into his pockets.
Grabbing Penny&rsquo;s elbow, he steered her toward the
gate. To get through the barrier, they fought their
way past the outsurging, panic-stricken tide of fleeing
employes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scared?&rdquo; Salt asked as they paused to stare at the
shooting flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Penny admitted truthfully. &ldquo;Will there
be any more explosions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the chance we&rsquo;re taking. DeWitt shouldn&rsquo;t
have sent you on this assignment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t know there would be other explosions,&rdquo;
Penny replied. &ldquo;Besides, someone had to cover
the story, and no one else was there. I can handle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you can too,&rdquo; said Salt quietly. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll
have to work alone. My job is to take pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you at the car,&rdquo; Penny threw over her
shoulder as she left him.</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing how or where to begin, she ran
toward the burning building. One of the smaller storage
structures of the factory, it was not connected
with the main office. The larger building remained
intact. Workmen with an inadequate hose were making
a frantic effort to keep the flames from spreading
to the other structures.</p>
<p>Penny ran up to one of the men, plucking at his
sleeve to command attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What set off the explosion?&rdquo; she shouted in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied above the roar of the
flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two workmen. They&rsquo;re over there.&rdquo; The man
waved his hand vaguely toward another building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Unable to gain more information, Penny ran toward
the nearby structure. The wind, she noted, was
carrying flames in the opposite direction. Unless
there were further explosions, danger of the fire
spreading was not great.</p>
<p>Entering the building, she met several men who appeared
to be officials of the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Mr. Conway!&rdquo; she accosted them.
&ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; one of the men asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Penny Parker from the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Conway. What do you want to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many killed and injured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two killed. Three or four injured. Perhaps
more. We don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny asked for names which were given her. But
when she inquired how the explosion had occurred,
Mr. Conway suddenly became uncommunicative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no statement to make,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t know what caused the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if fearing that Penny would ask questions he did
not wish to answer, the factory owner eluded her and
disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>Running back to the burning building, Penny
caught a glimpse of Salt taking a picture. From another
workman she sought to glean additional details
of the disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the foundry when the first blast went off!&rdquo;
he revealed. &ldquo;Just a minute before the explosion, I
seen a man in a light overcoat and a dark hat, run from
the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one I ever saw workin&rsquo; at this plant. But I&rsquo;ll
warrant, he touched off that explosion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think he was a saboteur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not place too much stock in the story,
but as she wandered about among the excited employes,
she heard others saying that they too had seen
the strange man running from the building. No one
knew his name nor could they provide an accurate description.</p>
<p>Sirens screamed, proclaiming the arrival of fire engines.
As the ladders went up, and streams of water
began to play on the blazing structure, Salt snapped
several more pictures. His hat was gone, and his face
had become streaked with soot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got some good shots!&rdquo; he told Penny enthusiastically
as he sought her at the fringe of the crowd.
&ldquo;What luck you having?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny told him everything she had learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk with the Fire Chief and then let&rsquo;s head
for a telephone and call the office,&rdquo; Salt declared.</p>
<p>As they started toward the fire lines, a strange sound
accosted their ears. Hearing it, Salt stopped short to
listen. From the gates outside the factory came the
rumbling murmur of an angry crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A mob must be forming!&rdquo; Salt exclaimed. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started for the gate with Penny hard at his heels.</p>
<p>At first they could not see what had caused the
commotion. But as the group of angry employes
swept nearer the gate, a man in a light overcoat who
apparently was fleeing for his life, leaped into a car
which waited at the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;Take a picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt already had his camera into position. As the
car started up, the flash bulb went off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; Salt exclaimed triumphantly.</p>
<p>Penny tried to note the license number of the automobile,
but the plate was so covered with mud she
could not read a single figure. The car whirled
around a corner and was lost to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt, that man may have been the one who set off
the explosion!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;The mob is of that
opinion at least!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry employes now were bearing directly toward
Penny and Salt. Suddenly a woman in the
crowd pointed toward the photographer, shouting:
&ldquo;There he is! Get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dismayed, Penny saw then that Salt wore a light
overcoat which bore a striking resemblance to the
garment of the fleeing stranger. Their builds too
were somewhat similar, for both were thin and angular.
In the darkness, the mob had failed to see the car
roll away, and had mistaken Salt for the saboteur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo; Salt muttered. &ldquo;One thing
you can&rsquo;t do is argue with a mob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Penny started in the opposite direction,
only to be faced by a smaller group of workmen who
had swarmed from another factory gate. Escape was
cut off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them we&rsquo;re from the <i>Star</i>!&rdquo; Penny urged, but
as she beheld the angry faces, she realized how futile
were her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll wreck my equipment before I can explain
anything!&rdquo; Salt said swiftly. He thrust the camera
into her hands. &ldquo;Here, take this and try to keep it
safe! And these plates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Empty-handed, Salt turned to face the mob. Not
knowing what to do, Penny tried to cut across the
street. But the crowd evidently had taken her for a
companion of the saboteur, and was determined she
should not escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her get away!&rdquo; shouted a woman in
slacks, her voice shrill with excitement. &ldquo;Get her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A car was coming slowly down the street. Its
driver, a woman, was watching the flaming building,
and had rolled down the window glass to see better.
The window of the rear seat also was halfway down.</p>
<p>As the women of the mob bore down upon Penny,
she acted impulsively to save Salt&rsquo;s camera and the precious
plates. Without thinking of the ultimate consequence,
she tossed them through the open rear window
onto the back seat of the moving car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>The driver, her attention focused upon the blazing
factory, apparently did not observe the act, for she
continued slowly on down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D F 3005,&rdquo; Penny noted the license number. &ldquo;If
only I can remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The factory women were upon the girl, seizing her
roughly by the shoulders and shouting accusations.
Penny&rsquo;s jacket was ripped as she jerked free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reporter for the <i>Star</i>!&rdquo; she cried desperately.
&ldquo;Sent here to cover the story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words made not the slightest impression upon
the women. But before they could lay hands upon
her again, she fled across the street. The women did
not pursue her, for just then two police cars rolled up
to the curb.</p>
<p>Penny, greatly relieved, ran to summon help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; she urged the policemen. &ldquo;That crazy
mob has mistaken a reporter for one of the saboteurs
who escaped in a car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With drawn clubs, the policemen battled their way
through the crowd. Already Salt had been roughly
handled. But arrival of the police saved him from further
mistreatment, and fearful of arrest, the mob began
to scatter. In another moment the photographer was
free, although a bit battered. His coat had been torn
to shreds, one eye had been blackened, and blood
trickled from a cut on his lower lip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; he asked anxiously as Penny
rushed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! But you&rsquo;re a sight, Salt. They half
killed you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; Salt insisted. &ldquo;The important thing is
we&rsquo;ve got a whale of a story, and we saved the camera
and pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stricken look came over Penny&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Your camera&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was smashed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I tossed it into a car, but the car went on down
the street. How we&rsquo;ll ever find it again I don&rsquo;t
know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>THE MISSING PLATES</i></h2>
<p>Salt did not criticise Penny when he learned exactly
what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather lose a dozen pictures than have my camera
smashed,&rdquo; he declared to cheer her. &ldquo;Anyway,
we may be able to trace the car and get everything
back. Remember the license number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D F 3005,&rdquo; Penny said promptly, and wrote it
down lest she forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call the license bureau and get the owner&rsquo;s
name,&rdquo; the photographer proposed, steering her toward
a corner drugstore. &ldquo;Gosh, it&rsquo;s late!&rdquo; he added,
noticing a clock in a store window. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re
holding the paper for our story and pictures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly messed everything up,&rdquo; Penny said dismally.
&ldquo;At the moment, it seemed the thing to do.
When those women started for me, I thought it was
the only way to save the camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; Salt comforted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
the camera back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how will we catch the edition with your pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a horse of a different color,&rdquo; Salt admitted
ruefully. &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s my funeral. I&rsquo;ll tell DeWitt
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him myself,&rdquo; Penny said firmly. &ldquo;I lost the
pictures, and I expect to take responsibility for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not worry ahead. Maybe we can trace that
car if we have luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the drugstore, Penny immediately telephoned
Editor DeWitt at the <i>Star</i>, reporting all the
facts she had picked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he praised. &ldquo;One of our men
reporters, Art Bailey, is on his way out there now.
He&rsquo;ll take over. Tell Salt Sommers to get in here fast
with his pictures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll call you in just a minute or two,&rdquo; Penny said
weakly.</p>
<p>From another phone, Salt had been in touch with
the license bureau. As Penny left the booth to join
him, she saw by the look of his face that he had had
no luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you get the name of the owner?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that, Penny. The license was made
out to a man by the name of A. B. Bettenridge. He
lives at Silbus City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silbus City! At the far end of the state!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the size of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did the car happen to be in Riverview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man or his wife probably is visiting relatives
here, or possibly just passing through the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no way to trace them,&rdquo; Penny said,
aghast. &ldquo;Oh, Salt, I&rsquo;ve not only lost your pictures,
but your camera as well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; Salt said brusquely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that bad.
We&rsquo;re sunk on the pictures, that&rsquo;s sure. But unless
the people are dishonest, I&rsquo;ll get the camera again.
I&rsquo;ll write a letter to Silbus City, or if necessary, go
there myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had little to say as she rode back to the <i>Star</i>
office with the photographer. Editor DeWitt was
not in the newsroom when they returned, but they
found him in the composing room, shouting at the
printers who were &ldquo;making up the paper&rdquo; to include
the explosion story.</p>
<p>Seeing Penny and Salt, he whirled around to face
them. &ldquo;Get any good pictures?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost all of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Salt confessed, his face long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost the pictures. The mob tore into us, and we
were lucky to get back alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt&rsquo;s stony gaze fastened briefly upon Salt&rsquo;s
scratched face and torn clothing, &ldquo;One of the biggest
stories of the year, and you lose the pictures!&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; Penny broke in. &ldquo;I tossed the
camera and plates into a passing car. I was trying to
save them, but it didn&rsquo;t work out that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt&rsquo;s eyebrows jerked upward and he listened
without comment as Penny told the story. Then he
said grimly: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine! That&rsquo;s just dandy!&rdquo; and
stalked out of the composing room.</p>
<p>Penny gazed despairingly at Salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t told him it was your fault, he&rsquo;d have
taken it okay,&rdquo; Salt sighed. &ldquo;Oh, well, it was the only
thing to do. Anyway, there&rsquo;s one consolation. He
can&rsquo;t fire you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he would. Salt, I feel worse than a worm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, buck up, Penny! Things like this happen.
One has to learn to take the breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like this ever happened before&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure
of that,&rdquo; Penny said dismally. &ldquo;What ought I to do,
Salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;Just show up for
work tomorrow the same as ever and don&rsquo;t think any
more about it. I&rsquo;ll get the camera back, and by tomorrow
DeWitt will have forgotten everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very optimistic,&rdquo; Penny returned. &ldquo;Very
optimistic indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not wishing to return through the newsroom, she
slipped down the back stairs and took a bus home.
The Parker house stood on a knoll high above the
winding river and was situated in a lovely district of
Riverview. Only a few blocks away lived Louise
Sidell, who was Penny&rsquo;s closest friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Reluctant to face her father, Penny lingered for a
while in the dark garden, snipping a few roses. But
presently a kitchen window flew up, and Mrs. Maude
Weems, the family housekeeper called impatiently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny Parker, is that you prowling around out
there? We had our dinner three hours ago. Will you
please come in and explain what kept you so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny drew a deep sigh and went in out of the
night. Mrs. Weems stared at her in dismay as she entered
the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what have you done to yourself!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look dreadful! Your hair isn&rsquo;t combed&mdash;your
face is dirty&mdash;and your clothes! Why, they smell of
smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Dad tell you I started to work for the <i>Star</i>
today?&rdquo; Penny inquired innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very idea of you coming home three hours
late, and looking as if you had gone through the rollers
of my washing machine! I&rsquo;ll tell your father a thing
or two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems had cared for Penny since the death
of Mrs. Parker many years before. Although employed
as a housekeeper, salary was no consideration,
and she loved the girl as her own child. Penny and
Mr. Parker regarded Mrs. Weems almost as a member
of the family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Dad?&rdquo; Penny asked uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not disturb him now, Mrs. Weems. I&rsquo;ll just
have a bite to eat and slip off to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t want to see your father?&rdquo; the housekeeper
demanded alertly. &ldquo;Why, may I ask? Is there
more to this little escapade than meets the eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Penny admitted. Then she added earnestly:
&ldquo;Believe me, Mrs. Weems, I&rsquo;ve had a wretched
day. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll tell you everything. Tonight I
just want to get a hot bath and go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems instantly became solicitous. &ldquo;You
poor thing,&rdquo; she murmured sympathetically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
you some hot food right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without asking another question, the housekeeper
scurried about the kitchen, preparing supper. When
it was set before her, Penny discovered she was not as
hungry as she had thought. But because Mrs. Weems
was watching her anxiously, she ate as much as she
could.</p>
<p>After she had finished, she started upstairs. In passing
her father&rsquo;s study, she saw his eyes upon her. Before
she could move on up the steps, he came to the
doorway, noting her disheveled appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hard day at the office?&rdquo; he inquired evenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Penny could not know how much her father already
had learned, but from the twinkle of his eyes she
suspected that DeWitt had telephoned him the details
of her disgrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a little overtime work,&rdquo; she flung carelessly
over her shoulder. &ldquo;See you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny took a hot bath and climbed into bed. Then
she climbed out again and carefully set the clock
alarm for eight o&rsquo;clock. Snuggling down once more,
she went almost instantly to sleep.</p>
<p>It seemed that she scarcely had closed her eyes when
the alarm jangled in her ear. Drowsily, Penny reached
and turned it off. She rolled over to go to sleep again,
then suddenly realized she was a working woman and
leaped from bed.</p>
<p>She dressed hurriedly and joined her father at the
breakfast table. He had two papers spread before
him, the <i>Star</i>, and its rival, the <i>Daily Times</i>. Penny
knew from her father&rsquo;s expression that he had been
comparing the explosion stories of the two papers, and
was not pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news this morning?&rdquo; she inquired a bit too
innocently.</p>
<p>Her father shot back a quick, quizzical look, but
gave no further indication that he suspected she might
have had any connection with the Conway Steel Plant
story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they did a little dynamiting last night,&rdquo; he
replied, shoving the papers toward her. &ldquo;The <i>Times</i>
had very good pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny scanned the front pages. The story in the
<i>Star</i> was well written, with her own facts used, and a
great many more supplied by other reporters. But in
comparison to the <i>Times</i>, the story seemed colorless.
Pictures, she realized, made the difference. The <i>Times</i>
had published two of them which half covered the
page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see how DeWitt slipped up,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
said, shaking his head sadly. &ldquo;He should have sent
one of our photographers out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker, who had finished his breakfast, hastily
shoved back his chair. &ldquo;Well, I must be getting to
the office,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be late, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, about that story last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time now,&rdquo; he interposed. &ldquo;On a newspaper,
yesterday&rsquo;s stories are best forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny understood then that her father already
knew all the details of her downfall. Relieved that
there was no need to explain, she grinned and hurriedly
ate her breakfast.</p>
<p>Because her father had taken the car and gone on,
she was compelled to battle the crowd on the bus.
The trip took longer than she had expected. Determined
not to be late for work, she ran most of the way
from the bus stop to the office. By the time she had
climbed the stairs to the newsroom, she was almost
breathless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>As she came hurriedly through the swinging door,
Elda Hunt, cool and serene, looked up from her typewriter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the rush?&rdquo; she drawled, but in a voice which
carried clearly to everyone in the room. &ldquo;Are you
going to another fire?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>SHADOW ON THE SKYLIGHT</i></h2>
<p>Ignoring the thrust, Penny hung up her hat
and coat and went to work. Neither Editor DeWitt
nor his assistant, Mr. Jewell, made any reference to
the explosion story of the previous day.</p>
<p>Another reporter had written the &ldquo;follow-up&rdquo; on
it which Penny read with interest. Cause of the explosion,
responsible for more than $40,000 damages,
had not yet been determined. However, Fire Chief
Schirr had stated that there was evidence the explosion
had not been accidental. Several witnesses had
reported seeing a man in light overcoat flee from the
building only a few minutes before the disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have been the fellow who leaped into that
waiting car and escaped!&rdquo; Penny thought. &ldquo;And to
think, Salt&rsquo;s picture might actually be evidence in the
case, if I hadn&rsquo;t thrown it away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>She was staring glumly at the story when DeWitt
motioned for her to take a telephone call. It was another
obituary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After muffing a good story, I&rsquo;ll probably be assigned
to these things for the rest of my time on the
paper,&rdquo; Penny thought as she mechanically scribbled
notes.</p>
<p>All morning the obituaries kept coming in, and then
there were the hospitals to call for accident reports,
and the weather bureau. After lunch, a reporter was
needed to interview a famous actress who had arrived
in Riverview for a personal appearance. It was just
the story Penny wanted to try. She knew she could
do it well, for in months past, she frequently had contributed
special feature stories to the paper.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWitt&rsquo;s gaze focused upon her for an instant,
but he passed her by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elda,&rdquo; he said, and she went quickly to his desk to
receive instructions.</p>
<p>Elda was gone a long while on the assignment.
When she returned in the afternoon, she spent nearly
two hours typing the interview. Several times Editor
DeWitt glanced impatiently at her, and finally he said:
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a start on that story, Elda. You&rsquo;ve been
fussing with it long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave it to him. As Mr. DeWitt read, he used
his pencil to mark out large blocks of what had been
written. But as he gave the story to a copy reader
who would write the headline, he said: &ldquo;Give her a
byline.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Elda heard and grinned from ear to ear. A byline
meant that a caption directly under the headline
would proclaim: &ldquo;By Elda Hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, who also heard, could not know that Mr.
DeWitt had granted the byline only because it was
customary with a personal interview story. She felt
even more depressed than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if you can find a picture of this actress in the
photography room,&rdquo; DeWitt instructed Elda. &ldquo;Salt
Sommers took one this morning, but it hasn&rsquo;t come up
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a swishing of skirts, for she now was in a fine
mood, Elda disappeared down the corridor. Fifteen
minutes elapsed. Penny, busy writing hand-outs and
obituaries, had forgotten about her entirely, until Mr.
DeWitt summoned her to his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if you can find out what became of Elda,&rdquo; he
said in exasperation. &ldquo;Tell her we&rsquo;d like to have that
picture for today&rsquo;s paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went quickly toward the photography room.
The door was closed. As she opened it, she was startled
half out of her wits by hearing a shrill scream.
The cry unmistakably came from an inner room of the
photography studio and was Elda&rsquo;s voice. At the
same instant, a gust of cool air struck Penny&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Elda!&rdquo; she called in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; came the girl&rsquo;s muffled voice from the inner
room.</p>
<p>Fearing the worst, Penny darted through the doorway.
Elda had collapsed in a chair, her face white
with terror. Wordlessly, she pointed toward the
ceiling.</p>
<p>Penny gazed up but could see nothing amiss. Warm
sunshine was pouring through the closed skylight
which covered half the ceiling area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Elda?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why did you
scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skylight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the skylight?&rdquo; Penny demanded with
increasing impatience. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything wrong
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a moment ago I saw a shadow there,&rdquo; Elda
whispered in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shadow!&rdquo; Penny was tempted to laugh. &ldquo;What
sort of shadow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t describe it. But it must have been a human
shadow. I think a man was crouching there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, you must have imagined it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Elda insisted indignantly. &ldquo;I saw it
just before you opened the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the skylight open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Recalling the cool gust of wind that had struck her
face, Penny took thought. Was it possible that Elda
actually had seen someone crouching on the skylight?
However, the idea seemed fantastic. She could think
of no reason why any person would hide on the roof
above the photography room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, snap out of it, Elda,&rdquo; she said carelessly.
&ldquo;Even if you did see a shadow, what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a man, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A workman perhaps. Mr. DeWitt sent me to tell
you he was in a hurry for that picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell Mr. DeWitt to jump in an ink well!&rdquo;
Elda retorted angrily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been watching a shadow all this time,
I judge,&rdquo; Penny commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I went downstairs to get a candy
bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sigh, Elda pulled herself from the chair.
She really did look as if she had undergone a bad
fright, Penny observed. Feeling a trifle sorry for the
girl, she helped her find the photograph, and they
started with it to the newsroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not say anything about the shadow if I were
you, Elda,&rdquo; Penny remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it sounds rather silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so I&rsquo;m silly, am I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that, Elda. I said the idea of a shadow
on the skylight struck me that way. Of course, if you
want to be teased about it, why tell everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I didn&rsquo;t make a mess of an important
story,&rdquo; Elda retorted, tossing her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elda, why do you dislike me?&rdquo; Penny demanded
suddenly.</p>
<p>The question was so unexpected that it threw the
girl off guard. &ldquo;Did I say I did?&rdquo; she countered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious that you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I dislike,&rdquo; Elda said sharply.
&ldquo;The rest of us here have to work for our promotions.
You&rsquo;ll get yours without even turning a hair&mdash;just because
you&rsquo;re Mr. Parker&rsquo;s one and only daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not true, Elda. I&rsquo;m expected to earn my
way the same as you. I&rsquo;m working at a beginner&rsquo;s
salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect me to believe that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it because you thought I was making more
money than you, that you changed the name on the
Borman obituary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elda stopped short. She tried to register indignation,
but instead, only looked frightened. Penny was
certain of her guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told Mr. DeWitt, and I don&rsquo;t intend to,&rdquo;
she said quietly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m warning you! If anything
like that happens again, you&rsquo;ll answer for it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the nerve!&rdquo; Elda exploded, but her
voice lacked fire. &ldquo;Of all the nerve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny deliberately walked away from her.</p>
<p>The day dragged on. At five-thirty Penny covered
her typewriter and telephoned Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be late coming home tonight,&rdquo; she said apologetically.
&ldquo;I thought I might get dinner downtown
and perhaps go to a show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another hard day?&rdquo; the housekeeper asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much easier than yesterday,&rdquo; Penny said, making
her voice sound cheerful. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me.
I&rsquo;ll be home no later than nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though she would not have confessed it even to
herself, Penny was reluctant to meet her father at
dinner time. He might not ask questions, but his all-knowing,
all-seeing eyes would read her secrets. At
a glance he could tell that newspaper work was not
going well for her, and that she disliked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly won&rsquo;t give him an opportunity to even
think, &lsquo;I told you so,&rsquo;&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;Even if it kills
me, I&rsquo;ll stick here, and I&rsquo;ll pretend to like it too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because it was too early to dine, Penny walked aimlessly
toward the river. She paused at a dock to watch
two boys fishing, and then sauntered on toward the
passenger wharves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>A young man in an unpressed suit, and shoes badly
in need of a shine, leaned against one of the freight
buildings. Seeing Penny, he pulled his hat low over
his eyes, and became engrossed in lighting a cigarette.</p>
<p>She would have passed him by without a second
glance, save that he deliberately turned his back to
shield his face. The hunch of his shoulders struck her
as strangely familiar.</p>
<p>Involuntarily, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Ben! Ben Bartell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned then and she saw that she had not been
mistaken. The young man indeed was a former reporter
for the <i>Riverview Mirror</i>, a news magazine
published weekly. Ben had not shaved that day, and
he looked years older than when she last had seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Penny,&rdquo; he said uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, what has happened to you?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Why were you trying to avoid me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben did not reply for a moment. Then he said
quietly: &ldquo;Why should I want to see any of my old
friends now? Just look at me and you have your
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ben! You were one of the best reporters
the <i>Mirror</i> ever had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Were</i> is right,&rdquo; returned Ben with a grim smile.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t worked there for six months now. The
truth is, I&rsquo;m down and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s ridiculous, Ben! Nearly every paper
in town needs a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, you sound so bitter! What has happened to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, sister, and not for your dainty
little ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny now was deeply troubled, for she had known
Ben well and liked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, you must tell me,&rdquo; she urged, taking his arm.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going into a restaurant, and while we have
dinner together, you must explain why you left the
<i>Mirror</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>BEN&rsquo;S STORY</i></h2>
<p>Ben held back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said uncomfortably, &ldquo;but I think I
ought to be moving on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had your dinner?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do come with me, Ben. Or don&rsquo;t you want
to tell me what happened at the <i>Mirror</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, Penny. The truth is&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t the price of a dinner?&rdquo; Penny supplied.
&ldquo;Is that it, Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m practically broke,&rdquo; he acknowledged ruefully.
&ldquo;Sounds screwy in a day and age like this, but I&rsquo;m not
strong enough for factory work. Was rejected from
the Army on account of my health. Tomorrow I
guess I&rsquo;ll take a desk job somewhere, but I&rsquo;ve held off,
not wanting to get stuck on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a newspaper man, Ben. Reporting is all
you&rsquo;ve ever done, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m finished now. Can&rsquo;t get a job anywhere.&rdquo;
The young man started to move away, but
Penny caught his arm again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, you <i>are</i> having dinner with me,&rdquo; she insisted.
&ldquo;I have plenty of money, and this is my treat. I really
want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you pay for my dinner,&rdquo; Ben protested,
though with less vigor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly! You can take me somewhere as soon as you
get your job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you put it that way,&rdquo; Ben agreed, falling
willingly into step. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place here on the waterfront
that serves good meals, but it&rsquo;s not stylish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better. Lead on, Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her to a small, crowded little restaurant
only a block away. In the front window, a revolving
spit upon which were impaled several roasting chickens,
captured all eyes. Ben&rsquo;s glands began to work as
he watched the birds browning over the charcoal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, how long has it been since you&rsquo;ve had a real
meal?&rdquo; Penny asked, picking up the menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a week. I&rsquo;ve mostly kept going on pancakes.
But it&rsquo;s my own funeral. I could have had jobs of a
sort if I had been willing to take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gave her order to the waitress, taking double
what she really wanted so that her companion would
not feel backward about placing a similar order. Then
she said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, you remarked awhile ago that you can&rsquo;t get a
newspaper job anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;m blacklisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you try my father&rsquo;s paper, the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. I couldn&rsquo;t even get past his secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not like Dad,&rdquo; Penny said with troubled
eyes. &ldquo;Did you really do something dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Jason Cordell who put the bee on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jason Cordell?&rdquo; Penny repeated thoughtfully.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the editor of the <i>Mirror</i>, and has an office in the
building adjoining the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Well, he fired me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of reporters are discharged, Ben, but they
aren&rsquo;t necessarily blacklisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben squirmed uncomfortably in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me if you don&rsquo;t wish,&rdquo; Penny said
kindly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to pry into your personal affairs.
I only thought that I might be able to help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you, Penny. I really do. But I don&rsquo;t
dare reveal some of the facts, because I haven&rsquo;t sufficient
proof. I&rsquo;ll tell you this much. I stumbled into
a story&mdash;a big one&mdash;and it discredited Jason Cordell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t publish it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally not.&rdquo; Ben laughed shortly. &ldquo;I doubt if
any newspaper would touch it with a ten-foot pole.
Cordell is supposed to be one of our substantial, respectable
citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Actually?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as dishonorable as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that Ben was bitter because of his discharge,
Penny discredited some of the remarks, but
she waited expectantly for him to continue. A waitress
brought the dinner, and for awhile, as the reporter
ate ravenously, he had little to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to excuse me,&rdquo; he finally apologized.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tasted such fine food in a year! Now what
is it you want to know, Penny? I&rsquo;m in a mood to tell
almost anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was this scandal you uncovered about Mr.
Cordell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one thing I can&rsquo;t reveal, but it concerned
the owner of the Conway Steel Plant. They&rsquo;re
bitter enemies you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had not known, and the information interested
her greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you talk it over with Mr. Cordell?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the mistake I made.&rdquo; Ben slowly stirred
his coffee. &ldquo;Cordell didn&rsquo;t have much to say, but the
next thing I knew, I was out of a job and on the
street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that was why he discharged you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, not wishing to hurt Ben&rsquo;s feelings.
There were several things she had heard about him&mdash;that
he was undependable and that he drank heavily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the things you&rsquo;ve been told about me
aren&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; Ben said quietly, reading her thoughts.
&ldquo;Jason Cordell started a lot of stories intended to
discredit me. He told editors that I had walked off a
job and left an important story uncovered. He pictured
me as a drunkard and a trouble maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to my father,&rdquo; Penny promised. &ldquo;As short
as the <i>Star</i> is of employes, I&rsquo;m sure there must be a
place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re swell,&rdquo; Ben said feelingly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not
asking for charity. I&rsquo;ll get along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Refusing to talk longer about himself, he told
Penny of amusing happenings along the waterfront.
After dessert had been finished, she slipped a bill into
his hand, and they left the restaurant.</p>
<p>Outside, the streets were dark, for in this section of
the city, lights were few and far between. Ben offered
to escort Penny back to the <i>Star</i> office or wherever
she wished to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t too safe a part of the city for a girl,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;Especially after night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, to me the waterfront is the most fascinating
part of Riverview,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;You
seem to know this part of town well, Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should. I&rsquo;ve lived here for the past six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you where I live,&rdquo; Ben offered. &ldquo;Wait
until we reach the next corner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>They walked on along the river docks, passing warehouses
and vessels tied up at the wharves. Twice they
passed guards who gazed at them with intent scrutiny.
However, Ben was recognized, and with a friendly
salute, the men allowed him to pass unchallenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The waterfront is strictly guarded now,&rdquo; the reporter
told Penny. &ldquo;Even so, plenty goes on here that
shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben did not answer for they had reached the corner.
Beyond, on a vacant lot which Penny suspected might
also be a dumping ground, stood three or four dilapidated
shacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the third one,&rdquo; Ben indicated. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
my little mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ben!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad inside. A little cold when the wind
blows through the chinks, but otherwise, fairly comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, haven&rsquo;t you any friends or relatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here. I thought I had a few friends, but they
dropped me like a hot potato when I ran into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no life for you, Ben. I&rsquo;ll certainly talk to
my father tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben smiled and said nothing. From his silence,
Penny gathered that he had no faith she would be able
to do anything for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>They walked on, and as they approached a small
freighter tied up at the wharf, Ben pointed it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the <i>Snark</i>,&rdquo; he informed her.</p>
<p>The name meant nothing to Penny. &ldquo;Who owns
her?&rdquo; she inquired carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew, Penny. There&rsquo;s plenty goes on
aboard that vessel, but it&rsquo;s strictly hush-hush. I have
my suspicions that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben suddenly broke off, for several men had appeared
on the deck of the <i>Snark</i>. The vessel was some
distance away, and in the darkness only shadowy
forms were visible.</p>
<p>Seizing Penny&rsquo;s arm, Ben pulled her flat against a
warehouse.</p>
<p>Amazed by his action, she started to protest. Then
she understood. Aboard the <i>Snark</i> there was some
sort of disturbance or disagreement. The men, although
speaking in low, almost inaudible tones, were
arguing. Penny caught only one phrase: &ldquo;Heave him
overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, what&rsquo;s happening there?&rdquo; she whispered anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But nothing good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the guards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably at the far end of their beats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aboard the <i>Snark</i>, there was a brief scuffle, as someone
was dragged across the deck to the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach you!&rdquo; they heard one of the men
mutter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Then the helpless victim was raised and dropped
over the rail. Shrieking in terror, he fell with a great
splash into the inky waters. Frantically, he began to
struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fiends!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;They deliberately
threw the man overboard, and he can&rsquo;t swim!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>

<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>MAN OVERBOARD!</i></h2>
<p>Penny and Ben ran to the edge of the dock, peering
into the dark, oily waters. On the deck of the
<i>Snark</i> there was a murmur of voices, then silence.</p>
<p>Casting a quick glance upward, Penny was angered
to see that the men who had been standing there had
vanished into a cabin or companionway. Obviously,
they had no intention of trying to aid the unfortunate
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; Ben exclaimed, suddenly catching
another glimpse of the bobbing head. &ldquo;About done in
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kicking off his shoes and stripping off his coat, the
reporter dived from the dock. He struck the water
with an awkward splash, but Penny was relieved to see
that he really could swim well. He struck out for the
drowning man, but before he could reach him, the fellow
slipped quietly beneath the surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Close by were two barges lashed together, and the
current would take a body in that direction. Ben
jack-knifed and went down into the inky waters in a
surface dive. Unable to find the man, he came up,
filled his lungs in a noisy gulp, and went down again.
He was under such a long time that Penny became
frantic with anxiety.</p>
<p>She decided to turn in an alarm for the city rescue
squad. But before she could act, Ben surfaced again,
and this time she saw that he held the other man by the
hair.</p>
<p>As Ben slowly towed the fellow toward the dock,
Penny realized that she must find some way to get
them both out of the river. She could expect no help
from anyone aboard the <i>Snark</i>. Gazing upward again,
she thought she saw a man watching her from the vessel&rsquo;s
bow, but as her gaze focused upon him, he retreated
into deeper shadow, beyond view.</p>
<p>No guards were anywhere near, and the entire waterfront
seemed deserted. Penny&rsquo;s eyes fastened upon
a rope which hung loosely over a dock post. It was
long enough to serve her purpose, and finding it unattached,
she hurled one end toward Ben.</p>
<p>He caught it on the second try and made a loop fast
about the body of the man he towed. Penny then
pulled them both to the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t haul us up,&rdquo; Ben instructed from below.
&ldquo;Just hold on, and I think I can get out of here by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>He swam off in the darkness and was lost to view.
Penny clung desperately to the rope, knowing that if
she relaxed for an instant, the man, already half
drowned, would submerge for good. Her arms began
to ache. It seemed to her she could not hold on another
instant.</p>
<p>Then Ben, his clothes plastered to his thin body,
came running across the planks.</p>
<p>Without a word he seized the rope, and together
they raised the man to the dock. In the darkness
Penny saw only that he was slender, and in civilian
clothes.</p>
<p>Stretching him out on the dock boards, they prepared
to give artificial resuscitation. But it was unnecessary.
For at the first pressure on his back, the
man rolled over and muttered: &ldquo;Cut it out. I&rsquo;m
okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he lay still, exhausted, but breathing evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were lucky to get him, Ben,&rdquo; Penny said as
she knelt beside the stranger. &ldquo;If the current had carried
him beneath those barges, he never would have
been taken out alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to dive deep,&rdquo; Ben admitted. &ldquo;Found him
plastered right against the side of the first barge.
Yeah, I was lucky, and so is he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stirred again, and sat up. Penny tried to
support him, but he moved away, revealing that he
wanted no help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who pushed you overboard?&rdquo; Ben asked.</p>
<p>The man stared at him and did not answer.</p>
<p>Observing that Ben was shivering from cold, and
that the stranger too was severely chilled, Penny proposed
calling either the rescue squad or an ambulance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; muttered the rescued man, trying
to get up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay, and I&rsquo;m getting out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Ben&rsquo;s help, he managed to struggle to his feet,
but they buckled under him when he tried to walk.</p>
<p>The man looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to call the rescue squad,&rdquo; Penny decided
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a better idea,&rdquo; Ben supplied. &ldquo;We can take
him to my shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny thought that the man should have hospital
treatment. However, he sided with Ben, insisting he
could walk to the nearby shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; he repeated again. &ldquo;All I need is some
dry clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supported on either side, the man managed to walk
to the shack. Ben unlatched the door and hastily
lighting an oil lamp, helped the fellow to the bed
where he collapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, I think we should have a doctor&mdash;&rdquo; Penny began
again, but Ben silenced her with a quick look.</p>
<p>Drawing her to the door he whispered: &ldquo;Let him
have his way. He&rsquo;s not badly off, and he has reason
for not wanting anyone to know what happened. If
we call the rescue squad or a doctor, he&rsquo;ll have to answer
to a lot of questions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are some things I&rsquo;d like to know myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the answers if we&rsquo;re patient. Now stay
outside for a minute or two until I can get his clothes
changed, and into dry ones myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stepped outside the shack. A chill wind
blew from the direction of the river, but with its freshness
was blended the disagreeable odor of factory
smoke, fish houses and dumpings of refuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Ben!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He never should be living
in such a place as this! No matter what he&rsquo;s done,
he deserves another chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exactly what she believed about the reporter, Penny
could not have said. His courageous act had aroused
her deep admiration. On the other hand, she was
aware that his story regarding Jason Cordell might
have been highly colored to cover his own shortcomings.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes Ben opened the door to let
her in again. The stranger had been put to bed in a
pair of the reporter&rsquo;s pajamas which were much too
small for him. In the dim light from the oil lamp, she
saw that he had a large, square-shaped face, with a
tiny scar above his right eye. It was not a pleasant
face. Gazing at him, Penny felt a tiny chill pass over
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Ben also had changed his clothes. He busied himself
starting a fire in the rusty old stove, and once he
had a feeble blaze, hung up all the garments to dry.</p>
<p>The room was so barren that Penny tried not to
give an appearance of noticing. There was only a
table, one chair, the sagging bed, and a shelf with a
few cracked dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get along with him all right,&rdquo; Ben said, obviously
expecting Penny to leave.</p>
<p>She refused to take the hint. Instead she said:
&ldquo;This man will either have to go to a hospital or stay
here all night. He&rsquo;s in no condition to walk anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can have my bed tonight,&rdquo; Ben said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
manage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s intent eyes fastened first upon Penny
and then Ben. But not a word of gratitude did he
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need more blankets and food,&rdquo; Penny said,
thinking aloud. &ldquo;I can get them from Mrs. Weems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; Ben said stiffly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though rebuffed, Penny went over to the bedside.
Instantly she saw a bruise on the stranger&rsquo;s forehead
and a sizeable swollen place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he must have struck his head!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
then corrected herself. &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t strike
anything that we saw. Ben, he must have been slugged
while aboard the <i>Snark</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>The stranger turned so that he looked directly into
the girl&rsquo;s clear blue eyes. &ldquo;Nuts!&rdquo; he said emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our guest doesn&rsquo;t seem to care to discuss the little
affair,&rdquo; Ben commented dryly. &ldquo;I wonder why? He
escaped drowning by only a few breaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the stranger, hitching up on an elbow.
&ldquo;You fished me out of the water, but that don&rsquo;t give
you no right to put me through the third degree. My
business is my business&mdash;see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded Penny.</p>
<p>She thought he would refuse to answer, but after a
moment he said curtly: &ldquo;James Webster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Penny and Ben were certain that the man had
given a fictitious name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You work aboard the <i>Snark</i>?&rdquo; Ben resumed the
questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what were you doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why were you pushed overboard?&rdquo; Penny
demanded as the man failed to answer the first question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t pushed,&rdquo; he said sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did you get into the water?&rdquo; Penny
pursued the subject ruthlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tripped and fell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Penny and Ben looked at each other, and the latter
shrugged, indicating that it would do no good to question
the man. Determined to keep the truth from
them, he would tell only lies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect us to believe that,&rdquo; Penny said
coldly. &ldquo;We happened to see you when you went
overboard. There was a scuffle. Then the men who
threw you in, disappeared. For the life of me, I can&rsquo;t
see why you would wish to protect them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of things you can&rsquo;t see, sister,&rdquo; he
retorted. &ldquo;Now will you go away, and let me sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go,&rdquo; Ben urged in a low tone. &ldquo;Anyone as
savage as this egg, doesn&rsquo;t need a doctor. I&rsquo;ll let him
stay here tonight, then send him on his way tomorrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really think that is best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, Penny. We could call the police, but
how far would we get? This bird would deny he was
pushed off the boat, and we would look silly. We
couldn&rsquo;t prove a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Penny sighed. &ldquo;Well, I
hope everything goes well tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moving to the door, she paused there, for some
reason reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you home,&rdquo; Ben offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, stay here,&rdquo; Penny said firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid
to go alone. I only hope you get along all right with
your guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben followed her outside the shack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he said, once beyond hearing of the
stranger. &ldquo;This fellow is a tough hombre, but I know
how to handle him. If he tries to get rough, I&rsquo;ll heave
him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such ingratitude, Ben. After you
risked your life to save him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a dock rat,&rdquo; the reporter said carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, why should he refuse to answer questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, he&rsquo;s mixed up in some mess and doesn&rsquo;t
dare talk, Penny. I&rsquo;ve always had my suspicions about
the <i>Snark</i> and her owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the reporter could answer, there came a
thumping from inside the shack. Welcoming the interruption,
Ben turned quickly to re-enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you now,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
talk some other time. So long, and don&rsquo;t worry about
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Firmly, he closed the door.</p>
<p>Penny stood there a moment until satisfied that
there was no further disturbance inside the shack.
Then with a puzzled shake of her head, she crossed
the vacant lot to the docks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men aboard the <i>Snark</i> should be arrested,&rdquo;
she thought indignantly. &ldquo;I wish I could learn more
about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood for a moment lost in deep reflection.
Then with sudden decision, she turned and walked
toward the <i>Snark</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>A SWINGING CHAIN</i></h2>
<p>Approaching the <i>Snark</i>, Penny saw several
men moving about on the unlighted decks. But as she
drew nearer, their forms melted into the darkness.
When she reached the dock, the vessel appeared deserted.</p>
<p>Yet, peering upward at the towering vessel, the girl
had a feeling that she was being watched. She was
satisfied that the rescue of the man who called himself
James Webster had been observed. She was equally
certain that those aboard the <i>Snark</i> were aware of her
presence now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, the <i>Snark</i>!&rdquo; she called impulsively.</p>
<p>There was no answer from aboard the tied-up vessel,
but footsteps pounded down the dock. Penny
whirled around to find herself the target for a flashlight.
Momentarily blinded, she could see nothing.
Then, the light shifted away from her face, and she
recognized a wharf guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded gruffly.</p>
<p>Though tempted to tell the entire story, Penny held
her tongue. &ldquo;Just looking,&rdquo; she mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I hear you call out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know anyone aboard the <i>Snark?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then move along,&rdquo; the guard ordered curtly.</p>
<p>Penny did not argue. Slipping quietly away, she
sought a brightly lighted street which led toward the
newspaper office. Midway there, she stopped at a
corner drugstore to call home and inquire for her
father. Mrs. Weems told her that so far as she knew
Mr. Parker had returned to the <i>Star</i> office to do a little
extra work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll catch him there,&rdquo; Penny declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything wrong?&rdquo; the housekeeper inquired
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just something in connection with a news story,&rdquo;
Penny reassured her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hanging up the receiver before the housekeeper
could ask any more questions, she walked swiftly on
to the <i>Star</i> building. The front door was locked, but
Penny had her own key. Letting herself in through
the darkened advertising room, she climbed the stairs
to the news floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>A few members of the Sunday staff were working
at their desks, but otherwise the room was deserted.
Typewriters, like hooded ghosts, stood in rigid ranks.</p>
<p>Pausing to chat for a moment with the Sunday
editor, Penny asked if her father were in the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in his office a few minutes ago,&rdquo; the man
replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he left or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going on through the long newsroom, Penny saw
that her father&rsquo;s office was dark. The door remained
locked.</p>
<p>Disappointed, she started to turn back when she
noticed a light burning in the photography room. At
this hour she knew no one would be working there,
unless Salt Sommers or one of the other photographers
had decided to develop and print a few of his own
pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, are you there?&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>No one answered, but Penny heard a scurry of
footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt!&rdquo; she called, thinking it must be one of the
photographers.</p>
<p>Again there was no reply, but a gust of wind came
suddenly down the corridor. The door of the photography
room slammed shut.</p>
<p>Startled, Penny decided to investigate. She pushed
open the door. The light was on, but no one was in
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt!&rdquo; she called again, thinking that the photographer
might be in the darkroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>He did not reply. As she started forward to investigate,
the swinging chain of the skylight drew
her attention. The glass panels were closed and there
was no breeze in the room. Yet the brass chain swung
back and forth as if it had been agitated only a moment
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer!&rdquo; thought Penny, staring upward. &ldquo;Could
anyone have come in here through that skylight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea seemed fantastic. She could think of no
reason why anyone should seek such a difficult means
of entering the newspaper office. To her knowledge,
nothing of great value was kept in the photography
rooms.</p>
<p>Yet, the fact remained that the light was on, the
chain was swaying back and forth, and a door had
slammed as if from a gust of wind.</p>
<p>Studying the skylight with keen interest, Penny
decided that it would be possible and not too difficult
for a person on the roof to raise the glass panels, and
by means of the chain, drop down to the floor. But
could a prowler reverse the process?</p>
<p>Penny would have dismissed the feat as impossible,
had not her gaze focused upon an old filing cabinet
which stood against the wall, almost directly beneath
the skylight. Inspecting it, she was disturbed to find
imprints of a man&rsquo;s shoe on its top surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone was in here!&rdquo; Penny thought. &ldquo;To get
out, he climbed up on this cabinet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The brass handles of the cabinet drawers offered
convenient steps. As she tried them, the cabinet
nearly toppled over, but she reached the top without
catastrophe. By standing on tiptoe, her head and
shoulders would just pass through the skylight.</p>
<p>Pulling the brass chain, she opened it, and peered
out onto the dark roof. No one was in sight. In the
adjoining building, lights burned in a number of
offices.</p>
<p>Suddenly the door of the photography room
opened. Startled, Penny ducked down so fast that she
bumped her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for Pete&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; exclaimed a familiar voice.
&ldquo;What are you doing up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was relieved to recognize Salt. She closed
the skylight and dropped lightly to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for termites?&rdquo; the photographer asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two legged ones! Salt, someone has been prowling
about in here! Whoever he was, he came in
through this skylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so, kitten?&rdquo; Salt looked
mildly amused and not in the least convinced.</p>
<p>Penny told him what had happened and showed him
the footprints on the filing cabinet. Only then did the
photographer take her seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is something!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;But who
would sneak in here and for what reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have anything valuable in the darkroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only our cameras. Let&rsquo;s see if they&rsquo;re missing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Striding across the room, Salt flung open the door
of the inner darkroom, and snapped on a light. One
glance assured him that the cameras remained untouched.
But several old films were scattered on the
floor. Picking them up, he examined them briefly,
and tossed them into a paper basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has been here all right,&rdquo; he said softly.
&ldquo;But what was the fellow after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Films perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t anything of value here, Penny. If we
get a good picture we use it right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Methodically, Salt examined the room, but could
find nothing missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the person, whoever he was, didn&rsquo;t get
what he was after,&rdquo; Penny speculated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined
to think this isn&rsquo;t his first visit here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questioned by Salt, she revealed Elda Hunt&rsquo;s recent
experience in the photography room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dizzy dame!&rdquo; he dismissed the subject. &ldquo;She
wouldn&rsquo;t know whether she saw anything or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something frightened her,&rdquo; Penny insisted. &ldquo;It
may have been this same man trying to get in. Can&rsquo;t
the skylight be locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I suppose so,&rdquo; Salt agreed. &ldquo;The only
trouble is that this room gets pretty stuffy in the daytime.
We need the fresh air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least it should be locked when no one is here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that it is,&rdquo; Salt promised. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not
likely the prowler will come back again&mdash;especially as
you nearly caught him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was growing late. Convinced that her father had
left the <i>Star</i> building, Penny decided to take a bus
home. As she turned to leave, she asked Salt carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, did you know Ben Bartell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly well,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I met him tonight. He&rsquo;s had a run of hard
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt, what did Ben do, that caused him to be blacklisted
with all the newspapers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing, he socked an editor on the
jaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jason Cordell of the <i>Mirror</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they got into a fight of some sort. Ben was
discharged, and he didn&rsquo;t take it very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a hard drinker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben? Not that I ever heard. I used to think he
was a pretty fair reporter, but he made enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded, and without explaining why the information
interested her, bade Salt goodnight. Leaving
the <i>Star</i> building by the back stairway, she walked
slowly toward the bus stop.</p>
<p>As she reached the corner, she heard the scream of
a police car siren. Down the street came the ambulance,
pulling up only a short distance away. Observing
that a crowd had gathered, Penny quickened
her step to see who had been injured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Pushing her way through the throng of curious
pedestrians, she saw a heavy-set man lying unconscious
on the pavement. Policemen were lifting him onto a
stretcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Penny asked the man nearest
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a drunk,&rdquo; he said with a shrug. &ldquo;The fellow
was weaving all over the street, and finally collapsed.
A storekeeper called the ambulance crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and started to move away. Just
then, the ambulance men pushed past her, and she
caught a clear glimpse of the man on the stretcher.
She recognized him as Edward McClusky, a deep
water diver for the Evirude Salvage Company. She
knew too that under no circumstances did he ever
touch intoxicating liquors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she exclaimed to the startled ambulance
crew. &ldquo;I know that man! Where are you taking
him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>THE METAL DISC</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking this man to the lockup,&rdquo; the
policemen told Penny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be okay as soon as he
sobers up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not drunk,&rdquo; she protested earnestly. &ldquo;Edward
McClusky is a diver for the Evirude Salvage
Co. Whatever ails him must be serious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman stared at Penny and then down at
the unconscious man on the stretcher. &ldquo;A deep sea
diver!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s different!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deftly he loosened the man&rsquo;s collar, and at once his
hand encountered a small disc of metal fastened on a
string about his neck. He bent down to read what
was engraved on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward McClusky, 125 West Newell street,&rdquo; he
repeated aloud. &ldquo;In case of illness or unconsciousness,
rush this man with all speed to the nearest decompression
lock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; cried Penny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had an attack of
the bends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; exclaimed the policeman. He consulted
his companions. &ldquo;Where is the nearest decompression
chamber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aboard the <i>Yarmouth</i> in the harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll rush him there.&rdquo; The policeman
turned again to Penny. &ldquo;You say you know this man
and his family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not well, but they live only a few blocks from
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ride along in the ambulance,&rdquo; the policeman
suggested.</p>
<p>Penny rode in front with the driver, who during
the speedy dash to the river, questioned her regarding
her knowledge of the unconscious man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about him,&rdquo; she confessed.
&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, our housekeeper, is acquainted with
his wife. I&rsquo;ve heard her say that Mr. McClusky is
subject to the bends. Once on an important diving
job he stayed under water too long and wasn&rsquo;t properly
put through a decompression lock when he came
out. He is supposed to have regular check-ups from
a doctor, but he is careless about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being careless this time might have cost him his
life,&rdquo; the driver replied. &ldquo;When a fellow is in his
condition, he&rsquo;ll pass out quick if he isn&rsquo;t rushed to a
lock. A night in jail would have finished him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will he be all right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Even if he does
come out of it, he may be paralyzed for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what causes bends?&rdquo; Penny inquired
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nitrogen forms in bubbles in the blood stream,&rdquo;
the driver answered, and drew up at the waterfront.</p>
<p>Penny followed the stretcher aboard the <i>Yarmouth</i>.
In the emergency of offering quick treatment to McClusky,
no one heeded her. The man was rushed into
the air lock and placed on a long wooden bench.</p>
<p>A doctor went into the chamber with him, signaling
for the pressure to be turned on. Bends could be
cured, Penny knew, only by reproducing the deep
water conditions under which the man previously had
worked. Pressure would be raised, and then reduced
by stages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take?&rdquo; she asked a man who
controlled the pressure gauges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily only about twenty minutes,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;But it will take at least two hours with this
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he come out of it all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Too soon to tell
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To wait two hours was out of the question for
Penny. After discussing the matter with police, she
agreed to notify Mrs. McClusky of her husband&rsquo;s difficulty.
Glad to be rid of the duty, they dropped her
off at the house on West Newell street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Mrs. McClusky, a stout, red-faced woman with two
small children clinging to her skirts, seemed stunned
by the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew this would happen!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ed
has been so careless lately. Thank heavens, he was
taken to the decompression chamber instead of the
police station! A good friend of Ed&rsquo;s lost his life
because no one understood what was wrong with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny called a taxicab for Mrs. McClusky while she
excitedly bundled up the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, for letting me know and for helping
Ed,&rdquo; the woman murmured gratefully as she climbed
into the cab. &ldquo;Will you tell me your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just a reporter at the <i>Star</i>,&rdquo; Penny returned
carelessly. &ldquo;I do hope your husband suffers no
ill effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taxi rattled away. With a tired sigh, Penny
hastened on home. Lights burned downstairs, and
both her father and Mrs. Weems had waited up for
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t ask me where I&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; the girl
pleaded, as she tossed her hat into a chair and collapsed
on the sofa. &ldquo;What a night! I&rsquo;ve had enough
adventures to fill a book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Despite her admonition, both Mrs. Weems and her
father plied her with questions. Penny told them
about the deep sea diver and then worked back to the
story of what had happened in the photography room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you certain anyone came through the skylight?&rdquo;
her father asked dubiously. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound
convincing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Footprints don&rsquo;t lie, Dad. They were on top of
the cabinet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The janitor may have stood on it to fix a light
bulb or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny became slightly nettled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure someone
was sneaking around in that room tonight!&rdquo; she declared
flatly. &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t the janitor either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll order the skylight kept locked except during
office hours,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared, yawning. &ldquo;Any
further adventures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; Penny said, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ll keep until morning.
There&rsquo;s just one thing I want to ask you. Are
you in need of a good male reporter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker came instantly to life. &ldquo;Just lead me to
him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not hire Ben Bartell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker&rsquo;s face lost all animation. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
do that,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the type of reporter I want on my paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, I don&rsquo;t like to go into all this with you.
Ben has a bad reputation. He&rsquo;s hot tempered and
unreliable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he got into a fist fight with Jason Cordell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he foments trouble among employes. I
have enough problems without adding him to the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben didn&rsquo;t strike me as a trouble maker. Who told
you about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t remember&mdash;Jason Cordell, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;Cordell
hated him because Ben gained damaging evidence
against him! Then to protect himself, Cordell told lies
about Ben and got all of Riverview&rsquo;s publishers to
blacklist him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gave you that idea, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked to Ben tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me he filled you with hot air,&rdquo; the newspaper
owner commented dryly. &ldquo;Penny, you must
learn not to believe everything you hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll not consider hiring Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid not,&rdquo; her father declined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no special
liking for Jason Cordell, who always impressed me as
a stubborn, unscrupulous fellow, but I certainly can&rsquo;t
employ Ben without more evidence in his favor than
you have presented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is more,&rdquo; said Penny, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m too tired to
tell you tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>She went wearily to bed, and though she slept hard,
still felt tired when the alarm went off the next morning.
Hastening through breakfast, she rode with her
father to the office, and en route related to him how
Ben had rescued the stranger from the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commendable,&rdquo; nodded her father, &ldquo;but it still
doesn&rsquo;t prove he isn&rsquo;t a trouble maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, I think you&rsquo;re being unfair to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think you have been unduly influenced,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker returned. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ll tell you what
I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll have Mr. DeWitt investigate the young
man. If his findings are good, we&rsquo;ll give him another
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad! That&rsquo;s grand!&rdquo; Penny cried, squeezing
his arm.</p>
<p>At the office, Penny found a letter tucked behind
the roller of her typewriter. Although addressed to
her, it had been sent to the <i>Star</i>. Instantly she knew
the reason, for it was from Jerry Livingston, who had
worked for the paper many years.</p>
<p>Eagerly, she ripped open the envelope and read the
message. Jerry, in an Army camp in the west, expected
to pilot a big bomber to Hawaii within the
next few weeks. &ldquo;Best regards to the newspaper
gang,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news from Jerry?&rdquo; inquired Mr. DeWitt,
who had recognized the handwriting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Penny gave him the letter to read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tack it on the bulletin board,&rdquo; the editor suggested.
&ldquo;Jerry has a lot of friends here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny allowed him to keep the letter and thought
no more of it. Soon she became absorbed in the morning&rsquo;s
work. There were obituaries to write as usual,
but now and then Mr. DeWitt gave her a more interesting
task. Seemingly he had forgotten about her
unfortunate experience at the fire.</p>
<p>But Penny had not forgotten. It troubled her that
Salt&rsquo;s camera remained missing. When he came to the
desk to drop a handful of finished pictures, she asked
him what he had learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been able to trace the car yet,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll locate it eventually. Don&rsquo;t worry
about it, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning wore on. She saw Elda Hunt read
Jerry&rsquo;s letter on the bulletin board, and later giggle
and laugh as she talked with other girls in the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little witch said something uncomplimentary
about me!&rdquo; Penny thought. &ldquo;If I weren&rsquo;t the publisher&rsquo;s
daughter, I certainly would tangle with her!
Maybe I will yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock, she put on her hat, intending to
go to lunch. As she turned toward the wooden barrier
gate, she saw that the receptionist was talking to a
male visitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the name of the girl,&rdquo; she heard him
say distinctly, &ldquo;but she saved my life. I know she
works on the <i>Star</i> and I want to thank her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned then and saw her. &ldquo;Why, she looks like
the one my wife described!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McClusky!&rdquo; Penny greeted him, extending
her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re up and around today.
How do you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; he boomed in a voice which carried to every
desk in the room. &ldquo;Thanks to you. Aren&rsquo;t you the
girl who saved my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked the police to take you to the <i>Yarmouth</i> if
that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; Penny said self-consciously.
&ldquo;As for saving your life&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly did, and the doc will say the same
thing. Another ten minutes and I&rsquo;d have been too far
gone to have pulled out of it. Now I&rsquo;ll be okay&mdash;at
least unless I have another attack of bends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you&rsquo;re feeling better,&rdquo; Penny said,
edging away. She was painfully conscious that all of
the reporters were listening to the conversation. All
noise in the office had ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything I can do for you, just let me
know!&rdquo; the diver offered heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime when I need a good waterfront story, I
may call on you,&rdquo; Penny said jokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can give you a tip on anything, I sure will,&rdquo; he
promised. &ldquo;I know every inch of the river, and most
of the folks that live along &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard of a boat called the <i>Snark</i>?&rdquo; Penny
asked impulsively.</p>
<p>McClusky&rsquo;s expression changed. He lowered his
voice. &ldquo;Sure, I know the <i>Snark</i>,&rdquo; he nodded soberly.
&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a little tip. If you want a story&mdash;a good
hot one with plenty o&rsquo; trouble hooked up to it, then
just go hunting around her berth. Maybe sometime I
can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a friendly nod, he was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>COUNTRY SKIES</i></h2>
<p>No more was said to Penny about her unfortunate
experience at the Conway Steel Plant explosion,
but she considered herself responsible for Salt&rsquo;s lost
camera. Although the plates no longer would have
picture value from the newspaper standpoint, she
thought that they might provide a clue to the identity
of the man who had escaped by automobile.</p>
<p>Police had been unsuccessful in apprehending any
of the persons responsible for the explosion, and the
story had died out of the newspapers.</p>
<p>After working for a week at the <i>Star</i>, Penny was
tired in body and worn in mind. However, she was
beginning to enjoy the routine. To receive her first
hard-earned pay check gave her a real thrill of
pleasure.</p>
<p>Louise Sidell, a school girl friend who lived near the
Parker home, asked Penny how she planned to spend
the money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have the check framed,&rdquo; Penny laughed.</p>
<p>She and Louise were sitting on the front steps of the
Parker home, watching a chattering squirrel on the
lawn. It was a warm, sunny day with scarcely a cloud
coasting around in the azure sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we could have a picnic or go to the country,&rdquo;
Louise commented wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Penny asked, getting up. &ldquo;I intended
to drive to the waterfront this morning and see how
Ben Bartell is making out. Then we could go out into
the country from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Ben Bartell?&rdquo; Louise inquired with interest.</p>
<p>Penny related her experience near the <i>Snark</i>, telling
of the stranger who had been given shelter by the
newspaper reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben probably has learned all about him by this
time,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Shall we stop there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; agreed Louise enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Dressed in comfortable slacks, the chums prepared
sandwiches, and then, in Penny&rsquo;s battered old car,
drove to the waterfront.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much gasoline, so we can&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; she
warned as they parked not far from the vacant lot
where Ben&rsquo;s shack stood. &ldquo;Wonder if anyone will
be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking across the lot which was strewn with tin
cans and rocks, they tapped lightly on the sagging
door of the shack. Almost at once it was opened by
Ben who looked even less cheerful than when Penny
last had seen him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how is your patient this morning?&rdquo; she inquired
brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; replied Ben flatly. &ldquo;My watch with
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben nodded glumly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thanks a fellow
gets! I saved his life, took him in and gave him my
bed. Then he repays me by stealing my watch and
my only good sweater. It makes me sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ben, that is a shame! You didn&rsquo;t learn who
the man was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t put out a thing. All I know is that
his first name was Webb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you try to find him at the <i>Snark</i>?&rdquo; Penny
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but there they just raise their eyebrows, and
say they never heard of such a person. So far as anyone
aboard that tub is concerned, no one ever fell into
the brink either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, why not report to police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I considered it, but what good would it do?&rdquo; Ben
shrugged. &ldquo;The watch is gone. That&rsquo;s all I care
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those men aboard the <i>Snark</i> must be criminals!
We know they pushed Webb off the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably had good reason for doing it too,&rdquo; Ben
growled. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t prove anything&mdash;no use to
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, you&rsquo;re just discouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t be? I had planned on pawning
that watch. It would have kept me going for a couple
of weeks at least. I&rsquo;d join the Army, only they&rsquo;ve
turned me down three times already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise had not expected to stay long, but
with the reporter in such a black mood, they thought
they should do something to restore his spirits. Entering
the dingy little shack, Penny talked cheerfully of
her newspaper experiences, and told him that she had
spoken to her father about adding him to the editorial
staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d he say?&rdquo; the reporter demanded quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He promised to look into the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means he doesn&rsquo;t want me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. My father takes his time in arriving
at a decision. But it always is a just one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thanks anyhow,&rdquo; Ben said gloomily. &ldquo;I appreciate
how you&rsquo;ve tried to help, Penny. It&rsquo;s just no
use. Maybe I&rsquo;ll pull out of here and go to another
city where I&rsquo;m not known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Penny pleaded. &ldquo;Sit tight for a
few days, and something will break. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that Ben was too proud to take money,
she did not offer any. But before leaving, she gave
him a generous supply of their picnic food, and invited
him to ride along into the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; he declined. &ldquo;I would only spoil the
fun. I&rsquo;m in no mood today for anything except
grouching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visit, brief as it was, tended to depress the girls.
However, once they were speeding along the country
road, their spirits began to revive. By the time they
had reached a little town just beyond the state line,
they had forgotten Ben and his troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop somewhere near Blue Hole Lake,&rdquo; Penny
proposed. &ldquo;This locality is as pretty as we&rsquo;ll find anywhere.
Besides, I haven&rsquo;t much gasoline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; agreed Louise, amiable as always.</p>
<p>Finding a grove within view of the tiny lake, they
spread out their picnic lunch. Afterwards, they
stretched flat on their backs beneath the trees and relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; Penny finally remarked regretfully.
&ldquo;Time we&rsquo;re starting home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a drink of water first,&rdquo; Louise declared.
&ldquo;Pass me the thermos, will you please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo; Penny uncorked the bottle and held
it upside down. &ldquo;But we can stop at a farmhouse. I
see one just up the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the car, they drove a few hundred
yards down the highway, pulling up near a large two-story
frame house which bore a sign in the front
yard: &ldquo;Tourist rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>In response to their knock on the side door, a pleasant,
tired-faced woman of mid-fifty came to admit
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m full up,&rdquo; she said, assuming that they wished to
rent a room. &ldquo;My last suite was taken by the professor
and his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny explained that all they wanted was a drink
of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, just help yourselves at the well!&rdquo; the
woman exclaimed. &ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll fetch a clean glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep well, which operated with a chain and a
crank, was situated in a vine-covered summer house
only a few yards away. The farm woman, who said
her name was Mrs. Herman Leonard, showed them
how to operate it. The water, coming from deep in
the earth, was cool and sweet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must keep you quite busy, running a tourist
home,&rdquo; Penny said to make conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it does,&rdquo; sighed the woman. &ldquo;Most of my
roomers aren&rsquo;t so bad, but this last couple runs me
ragged. They seem to expect hotel service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor and his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Professor and Mrs. Bettenridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bettenridge,&rdquo; Penny repeated alertly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
that name before. Does the professor come from Silbus
City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never said. But he&rsquo;s an inventor, and he
brought his invention with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of invention is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A light ray machine which explodes mines on
land or sea. The affair is very complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Penny&rsquo;s expression of doubt, Mrs. Leonard
added: &ldquo;It really works too! The first night the professor
came here, he exploded a mine out in the lake.
Such a splash as it made! I saw it with my own eyes!
The professor expects to sell it to the Army or Navy
for a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it will do all he claims, why hasn&rsquo;t the government
taken it over before this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it takes a long while to complete negotiations,&rdquo;
Mrs. Leonard replied. &ldquo;The professor is expecting an
officer here tomorrow to witness another demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the machine kept? In your house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear no! The professor has it in a little shack
down by the lake. You can see the place from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leonard led the girls a short distance from the
summer house, pointing through the trees to a knoll at
the edge of Blue Hole Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor and his wife went down there a few
minutes ago,&rdquo; she revealed. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask
them to show you the invention? They might do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if we have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s take time,&rdquo; Louise urged. &ldquo;It sounds so
interesting, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, Penny agreed, and with her chum,
walked down the hill toward the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds fishy to me,&rdquo; she declared skeptically.
&ldquo;Probably this professor is just a crack-pot who thinks
he has a wonderful invention, but hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leonard said she saw a successful demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Lou. But how could a light ray machine
explode mines that were under water? Why, if it
could be done, military warfare would be revolutionized!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbelievable changes are coming every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one certainly is unbelievable! I&rsquo;ll take no
stock in it unless I see the machine work with my own
eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approaching the shack, the girls saw no one. The
door was closed. And it was locked, Penny discovered,
upon testing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one here,&rdquo; she said in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be around somewhere,&rdquo; Louise declared,
unwilling to give up. &ldquo;Maybe that car belongs
to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sedan stood in a weed-grown lane not far away.
Penny, turning to gaze carelessly at it, suddenly became
excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, this trip has been worth while!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Look at the license number of that auto! It&rsquo;s D F
3005!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>A FAMILIAR CAR</i></h2>
<p>Louise gazed again at the automobile parked in
the lane and at its mud-splattered license number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D F 3005,&rdquo; she read aloud. &ldquo;What about it,
Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that is the number of the car that went off
with Salt Sommers&rsquo; camera and plates the night of the
big explosion,&rdquo; her chum explained excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s the same auto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like it. Now I remember! Salt
traced the license to an owner named Bettenridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hopeful of recovering the lost property, Penny,
with Louise close at her side, tramped through the
high grass to the deserted lane. Apparently the car
owner had not gone far, for the doors had not been
locked.</p>
<p>Penny climbed boldly in. A glance assured her
that the camera or plates were not on the back seat
where they had been tossed. As Penny ran her hands
beneath the cushions, Louise plucked nervously at her
skirt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is coming, Penny! A man and a woman!
They&rsquo;re heading straight toward this car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; declared Penny, undisturbed. &ldquo;If
they own the car, we may be able to learn what became
of Salt&rsquo;s property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, middle-aged, was tall and thin and wore
rimless glasses. He walked with a very slight limp.
His wife, a striking brunette, who appeared many
years his junior, might have been attractive had she
not resorted to exaggerated make-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; the professor said, eyeing the
girls sharply. &ldquo;My car seems to interest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was searching for something I thought might be
on the back seat,&rdquo; Penny explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for a camera and plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret I still fail to follow you,&rdquo; the man said
stiffly. &ldquo;Why should our car contain a camera? My
wife and I take no interest in photography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you Professor Bettenridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed again at the car. &ldquo;This must be the
automobile,&rdquo; she said, deeply troubled. &ldquo;On the night
of the Conway Steel Plant explosion, I tossed a camera
and photographic plates into the back seat to prevent
them being destroyed by a mob.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not this car,&rdquo; said the professor with quiet finality.
&ldquo;I have not been in Riverview for nearly a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman who resembled your wife was driving
the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you accusing me of stealing a camera?&rdquo; the
woman demanded angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Certainly not! I just thought&mdash;&rdquo; Penny
became confused and finished: &ldquo;The camera was expensive
and didn&rsquo;t belong to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about the matter! You certainly
have your nerve accusing me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the professor, giving his wife a
significant, warning glance. &ldquo;There is no need for
disagreement. The young ladies are quite welcome to
search the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already looked,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;The
camera isn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it possible you were mistaken in the automobile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have jotted down a wrong license number,&rdquo;
Penny acknowledged reluctantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite all right,&rdquo; the professor assured her,
his tone now becoming more friendly. &ldquo;Do you girls
live near here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Riverview,&rdquo; Louise supplied eagerly. &ldquo;We
drove over for a picnic. Mrs. Leonard told us about
your light ray machine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Professor Bettenridge looked none too
pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said you might be willing to show it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leonard displays a remarkable interest in our
affairs,&rdquo; Mrs. Bettenridge commented sarcastically.</p>
<p>Again her husband shot her a warning glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, it is only natural that she should be interested
in such an amazing machine as ours,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I see no reason why the young ladies should not view
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, may we?&rdquo; Louise cried eagerly.</p>
<p>Although his wife scowled with displeasure, the
professor bade the girls follow him to the nearby
shack. The door was padlocked and he opened it
with a key.</p>
<p>Inside, the room was bare of furniture. There
were a few boxes and a large table upon which rested
a sizeable object covered with canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My secret ray machine is expected to revolutionize
warfare,&rdquo; the professor said proudly. &ldquo;Behold the
product of fifteen years of faithful work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dramatically he jerked aside the canvas cover, revealing
a complicated mechanism of convex and concave
mirrors which rotated on their bases. In the
center of the machine was a small crystal ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it operate?&rdquo; Louise asked, deeply impressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid a technical explanation would be too
involved for you to understand. Briefly, a musical
note produced on the crystal globe, is carried by ultra
violet ray to the scene of the mine. The vibration
will cause any unstable substance such as melinite to
explode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you claim you actually can explode mines
with this machine?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not only claim it, I have demonstrated the machine&rsquo;s
powers,&rdquo; Professor Bettenridge replied. &ldquo;How
I do it, of course, is my own secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you explode a mine for us now?&rdquo; Louise
questioned eagerly.</p>
<p>Professor Bettenridge looked mildly amused. &ldquo;My
dear young lady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you realize that mines
are very expensive? I have been able to obtain only
a few, and naturally I must save them for official tests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; stammered Louise. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, the demonstrations have a certain element
of danger,&rdquo; the professor resumed. &ldquo;I never give one
without my assistant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, who had been studying the machine with
increasing interest, remarked that a story about it
might make an interesting feature for the <i>Star</i>. To
her surprise, the professor did not seem to favor the
idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are employed by a newspaper?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask you to say nothing about this matter,&rdquo;
the professor directed. &ldquo;Under no circumstance
could I permit a story to be written about my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Publicity at this time might rob me of an opportunity
to sell the machine. A very prominent man,
James Johnson, is now considering its purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you were expecting to sell your invention
to the government,&rdquo; Penny said, puzzled.</p>
<p>Professor Bettenridge bit his lip. Obviously, he
was beginning to share his wife&rsquo;s annoyance at the
girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret I can&rsquo;t tell you all the details of my negotiations,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;My wife and I are very tired, so
if you will excuse us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Penny, taking the hint. &ldquo;Louise
and I must be on our way to Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started to leave, but before they could reach
the door, someone tapped lightly on it. Professor
Bettenridge and his wife exchanged a quick glance
which Penny could not fathom. For a fleeting instant,
she thought they both looked frightened.</p>
<p>Then the professor went to the door and opened
it. A little man in a derby hat and with an apologetic
manner stood on the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor, extending
his hand. &ldquo;My wife and I did not expect you until
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I came a little sooner than I planned,&rdquo; the newcomer
admitted. &ldquo;A business conference I had expected
to attend was postponed until tomorrow.
Naturally, that has upset my schedule. I had hoped
you might consent to a demonstration of your machine
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo; The professor seemed caught off
guard. &ldquo;But that is impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Johnson. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing, my assistant is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get in touch with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Besides, I have another engagement.&rdquo;
The professor hesitated and added: &ldquo;Officials of the
Navy have invited me to confer with them tonight at
the Gables Hotel in Riverview. I rather expect them
to make me a very attractive offer for my invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you promised me first option on it!&rdquo; Mr. Johnson
protested. &ldquo;If necessary, I can wait for the demonstration
tomorrow night, though it will greatly inconvenience
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow at eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; the professor nodded.
&ldquo;If you should care to put up a small sum of money as
a guarantee of your intentions, I promise to make no
final deal with the Navy until after that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Mr. Johnson agreed, taking out his
check book. &ldquo;Any amount you say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Feeling themselves no longer welcome by the Bettenridges,
Penny and Louise slipped quietly away.
As they climbed the hill they could hear the professor
and Mr. Johnson discussing the amount to be paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a graft, if you ask me,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;Poor
Mr. Johnson seems hypnotized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could see that test tomorrow night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. In fact, I&rsquo;d be willing to bet the machine
won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my doubting nature, I suppose. No, there&rsquo;s
more to it than that, Lou. Didn&rsquo;t you notice how
startled the Bettenridges were when their star customer
appeared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did look a bit upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the professor refused to give a demonstration
tonight, although obviously it would have been to his
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He explained he had an engagement with Navy
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I suspect was all a made-up story. No,
Lou, there must be another reason why the professor
was unwilling to give the demonstration. He probably
knows his machine won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re convinced he&rsquo;s a fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;Furthermore, I believe
he knows what became of Salt&rsquo;s camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t prove anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but if he would steal a camera he might also
take to swindle in a big way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing we can do unless we want to report
him to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a little idea,&rdquo; Penny confessed. &ldquo;As soon
as we reach Riverview I propose to check the Gables
Hotel and learn if any Navy men have registered
there. By talking to them, we may get at the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>

<br /><i>THE PROFESSOR&rsquo;S HELPER</i></h2>
<p>Climbing the hill, Penny and Louise sought their
parked car. The day had been an interesting one,
replete with surprises, and yet another surprise was in
store.</p>
<p>As they were ready to drive away, a man came
slowly down the road, cut across the Leonard yard
and vanished down a path which led toward Blue
Hole Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that fellow!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; agreed Louise, surprised by her chum&rsquo;s
tense manner. &ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s Webb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Webb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who was pushed off the <i>Snark</i> and who
stole Ben&rsquo;s watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would he be doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I want to learn! I&rsquo;d like to
get Ben&rsquo;s watch back for him!&rdquo; Quickly Penny
pushed open the car door and jumped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Penny?&rdquo; Louise asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow that man and learn for certain who he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; Louise protested. &ldquo;Besides, he looks
like an unpleasant sort of individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny paid no heed, but started off in pursuit of the
stranger. He had already disappeared among the trees
and was well on his way toward the lake. Not wishing
to be deserted, Louise quickly followed her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to the professor&rsquo;s shack!&rdquo; Penny observed
a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is another prospective buyer of the
secret ray machine,&rdquo; Louise speculated. &ldquo;Business
seems to be rushing today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was not convinced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is Webb,&rdquo;
she declared. &ldquo;If we can force him to admit his identity,
we may get Ben&rsquo;s watch back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not wishing to attract attention, the girls paused
behind a large rock on the hillside. From there they
could watch the man without being seen.</p>
<p>He walked directly to the shack and tapped on the
door. In a moment it was opened by the professor,
who looked anything but pleased to see the new arrival.
Closing the door behind him as if fearful that
Mr. Johnson would hear, he stepped out of doors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>The girls were too far away to overhear the conversation,
but they saw the two men talk earnestly together
for a moment. Then the man they believed to
be Webb, walked on down the hill toward the lake&rsquo;s
edge. Professor Bettenridge reentered the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; inquired Louise, straightening up
from a cramped position behind the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow Webb. I have a hunch he may be
the assistant Professor Bettenridge told Mr. Johnson
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the man wasn&rsquo;t expected here until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which may or may not have been true, Lou.
There&rsquo;s more to this deal than meets the eye. Let&rsquo;s
see what we can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the man had disappeared from view, so
the girls walked swiftly after him. Reaching the
lake&rsquo;s edge, they saw him striding along the sandy
beach. Apparently he had no suspicion that he was
being trailed, for he did not glance backward.</p>
<p>Presently the girls noticed another shack which
had been erected in a clump of trees a few yards back
from the beach. It was much smaller than the other
little house, a mere box-like structure with a flat, low
roof.</p>
<p>Walking directly toward it, the man unfastened a
padlock and went inside. He closed the door behind
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what is he doing in there?&rdquo; Penny fretted,
as minutes elapsed and the man remained inside the
building. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls could hear a peculiar grinding sound as if
from machinery turning inside the shack. The building
was windowless, so it was impossible to see what
was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is maddening!&rdquo; Penny muttered with increasing
impatience. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;?&rdquo; She broke off, and
gazed thoughtfully at the flat roof of the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, how is that building lighted?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From here it looks as if there might be double
panels of glass in the roof&mdash;a make-shift skylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, if we could get up there, we might be able
to see what is going on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get caught too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we&rsquo;re careful. We can climb that tree
which brushes against it, and perhaps see from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we should be caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll decide that part when the time comes,&rdquo;
Penny chuckled. &ldquo;This should be fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Circling the shack, they climbed into the low-hanging
boughs of a giant, scraggly maple tree. Inch by
inch lest they make a sound which would betray them,
they climbed out on the heavy branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, we&rsquo;re taking an awful chance,&rdquo; her chum
murmured nervously. &ldquo;If that man should look up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny whispered confidently. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
too busy with whatever he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Lying flat on the branch, she could look directly
through the glass. In the room below she saw at least
four large, oval-shaped mines without detonators,
made of steel.</p>
<p>Evidently the man had finished whatever work had
brought him to the shack, for he laid aside a tool, and
then went out the door, carefully locking it behind
him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were too late,&rdquo; Penny whispered in disgust
after the man was a safe distance down the beach. &ldquo;I
wish I knew why he came here! One thing is certain,
he&rsquo;s mixed up with Professor Bettenridge on this secret
ray invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still believe the man is the one who was
pushed off the <i>Snark</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, and that part we can learn!&rdquo; Realizing
that much valuable time was being wasted, Penny slid
down from the tree, snagging a stocking in the process.
She helped Louise to reach the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan now?&rdquo; her chum asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Webb evidently is returning either to Professor
Bettenridge&rsquo;s shack or to town. Let&rsquo;s overtake him
and I&rsquo;ll ask a few questions. After helping fish him
out of the river, I certainly have the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man walked directly toward the shack which
contained the secret ray apparatus, but when he drew
close, paused and whistled twice as if in signal. No
response came from within the cabin. Seemingly the
man expected none, for he turned and selected a trail
which led toward the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>At that moment, the shack door opened. Professor
Bettenridge, his wife, and Mr. Johnson came out together,
chatting pleasantly. Without paying the
slightest heed to Webb, they walked toward the farmhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of all that?&rdquo; Louise asked in
perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;But I have a
suspicion the professor doesn&rsquo;t want Mr. Johnson to
know Webb is here today. He might insist on a test
of the secret ray machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why all the mystery? Professor Bettenridge certainly
can&rsquo;t expect to sell the invention unless he can
give a successful demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect that may be the point, Lou. Things
aren&rsquo;t properly set for a successful test today. Tomorrow
night may be a different story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the machine is as good as the professor
claims, it should explode mines as well one time as
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should,&rdquo; Penny agreed, &ldquo;but whether or not it
does, is a horse of a different color. My guess is that
the professor is a fraud, and that Webb helps him in
his scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>The man believed to be Webb walked so rapidly
that the girls realized they would lose sight of him
unless they hastened on. Cutting across a field, they
were able to get ahead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Webb,&rdquo; Penny whispered as they waited
for the man to approach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not until he was quite close did the man see the
girls. Momentarily startled at recognizing Penny, he
ignored her, and would have passed without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Webb!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man halted, gazing at her with ice-cold, unfriendly
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Webb ain&rsquo;t my name,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;I never
saw you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not remember. I helped pull you out of
the river after you had fallen from the deck of the
<i>Snark</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you coo-coo?&rdquo; the man demanded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you do,&rdquo; Penny said, losing patience. &ldquo;You
stayed with Ben Bartell at his shack by the river. For
saving your life, you repaid him by stealing his
watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, young lady, better be careful what you&rsquo;re
sayin&rsquo;!&rdquo; the man snapped. &ldquo;No one can accuse me of
being a thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Ben&rsquo;s watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man started on down the road, but Louise and
Penny stood their ground, blocking his way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want the watch!&rdquo; Penny repeated firmly. &ldquo;If
you won&rsquo;t give it up, I&rsquo;ll report you to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you will, eh?&rdquo; The man whirled toward her,
his face convulsed with anger. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get no watch
from me, but here&rsquo;s something to teach you to mind
your own business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cruel laugh, he pushed her so hard that she
sprawled backwards into the ditch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>BEHIND OFFICE DOORS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Penny?&rdquo; Rushing to her chum,
Louise helped her out of the ditch where she had
fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Angrily, Penny brushed dust from her
slacks. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m as mad as a hornet! If that man
thinks he can push me around&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Webb was well down the road, walking
at a leisurely but arrogant pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, forget it,&rdquo; Louise soothed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d get
no place picking a quarrel with a man like that. Anyway,
you more or less accused him of thievery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a thief is exactly what he is!&rdquo; Penny retorted.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a doubt in my mind that he&rsquo;s the one
who stole Ben&rsquo;s watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the thing for us to do is report him to the
police. We&rsquo;ll get nowhere talking to him ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop in town&mdash;I think the place is called
Newhall&mdash;and notify the sheriff,&rdquo; Penny decided.
&ldquo;I certainly shall ask for the man&rsquo;s arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the car, she turned it around, and they
drove toward the town, less than a half mile away.
Soon they approached Webb who was walking at the
side of the pavement. Deliberately, he ignored them
as they passed.</p>
<p>At Newhall, the girls found the sheriff, and rather
excitedly, poured out their story. Although the official
took a few notes, he seemed somewhat bored by
it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the last name of the man,&rdquo; he
recited. &ldquo;You think he may be employed by Professor
Bettenridge, but you are not sure. You believe
he may be a thief, but you are not positive of that
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I am sure of!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;He
pushed me into a ditch. So at least he&rsquo;s guilty of
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to sign charges and appear against
the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I would have to come back here later
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s enthusiasm waned. &ldquo;Maybe I couldn&rsquo;t get
here,&rdquo; she said, thinking of her newspaper work.
&ldquo;Oh, well, let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on the man anyhow,&rdquo; the sheriff
promised. &ldquo;Think you have the situation sized up
wrong though. We&rsquo;ve already investigated Professor
Bettenridge. He has fine credentials, and his invention
seems to have merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe it actually will explode mines?&rdquo; Penny
asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it done. Fact is, Professor Bettenridge invited
me to the first demonstration he gave at the
lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Louise questioned eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mine was dumped into the lake. Then the professor
exploded it with his machine. I didn&rsquo;t understand
how it was done, but I saw the flames shoot up
when it went off. It was the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly let-down, Penny and Louise took leave
of the sheriff and drove to Riverview. But as they
passed through the downtown section, Penny suddenly
stopped in front of the Gables Hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m silly,&rdquo; she acknowledged, &ldquo;but I still
doubt the honesty of Professor Bettenridge. Just for
the fun of it, I intend to run in here and learn if those
Navy officials are registered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving her chum in the car, Penny was gone
nearly fifteen minutes. When she returned, her face
had taken on animation, so Louise knew she had interesting
news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed, sliding behind
the steering wheel. &ldquo;Not a Navy officer
registered in the hotel, and none expected! So how could
Professor Bettenridge have an appointment here tonight?
He merely told Mr. Johnson that to impress
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look that way. Still, it&rsquo;s possible the officers
might have registered at another hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possible but hardly probable. Lou, I believe Professor
Bettenridge is a crook. I wish we could witness
that demonstration of his tomorrow night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to go,&rdquo; Louise said regretfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing in a recital&mdash;worse luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might get Salt to ride over with me,&rdquo; Penny
thought aloud. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following morning she took time from her
work to seek the photographer. He was in the darkroom,
but the door was open. As she stepped inside,
he whirled around, his face startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; he chuckled in relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Salt!&rdquo; Penny teased. &ldquo;You acted as if you
thought I might be a holdup man. Why so jumpy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I?&rdquo; the photographer asked, his tone queer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly were. Anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place was entered again last night,&rdquo; Salt said
reluctantly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing so far as I can discover. That&rsquo;s the
strange part of it. But the films were disturbed, as
if someone had searched through them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did the person get in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently through the skylight. It was ordered
locked, but it got hot in here yesterday. One of the
boys opened it up, and then forgot to snap the lock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you search the roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we found footprints leading to a hall window
of the next building. That was as far as they could
be traced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it could be anyone from the adjoining
building, Salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. The person may have entered it
from the street. We know he stepped out onto the
roof from the hall window rather than from one of
the office rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before returning to the newsroom, Penny told Salt
about yesterday&rsquo;s adventure in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure would like a chance to go there with you
tonight,&rdquo; he declared promptly. &ldquo;Maybe we can get
my camera back, even if those birds deny having
seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning passed slowly, and Penny found it
difficult to keep her mind on her work. Elda, however,
no longer bothered her. With more important
problems to worry about, Penny was not the least
bit wounded by the little slurring remarks the girl
made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>At noon she lunched on a sandwich and chocolate
at a corner drugstore close to the <i>Star</i> building. With
half an hour to spend, she suddenly was struck by an
idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I talk to Jason Cordell, the <i>Mirror</i>
editor, about Ben?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Perhaps their difficulties
are based on misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crossing the street to the <i>Mirror</i> building, she found
Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s office on the third floor. There, a secretary
asked her to wait a few minutes.</p>
<p>Apparently an argument was in progress within the
inner room, for she heard angry voices. Then a door
slammed. Presently, Penny was told that she might
go in.</p>
<p>Mr. Cordell sat at his desk, a scowl on his face. He
was busy writing and barely glanced up as she entered.
Finally he looked straight at her, demanding:
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; in a tone which sapped Penny&rsquo;s courage.</p>
<p>She wished she might retreat, but it now was too
late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am Miss Parker,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;My father
is publisher of the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes indeed,&rdquo; the editor now became more
friendly, and Penny took heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to talk to you about one of your former
employes&mdash;Ben Bartell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mask-like expression came over Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s
face. He waited for Penny to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You discharged Ben, I believe. He&rsquo;s had a very
hard time ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? Is he a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way. I feel sorry for him and I want to find
newspaper work for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why doesn&rsquo;t your father give him a job on
the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was prepared for the question. &ldquo;I think my
father would if he were assured that Ben had done
nothing so very dishonorable. That&rsquo;s why I came to
you. Why was he discharged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t reply to that question. Nor
can I assure you that Ben was discharged on a trivial
offense. The opposite is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cordell arose. &ldquo;I am sorry, I can&rsquo;t discuss it,
Miss Parker. If you will excuse me for saying so, I
think the matter really is not your concern. My advice
would be to leave Ben Bartell entirely alone. He
sent you here, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Ben now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living in a shack on the waterfront. Because you
blacklisted him, he has been unable to get a newspaper
job anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s smile was hard and triumphant.
Penny knew then that she had made a grave error in
thinking she might appeal to the man&rsquo;s sympathies.
Obviously, he was highly pleased to learn of Ben&rsquo;s
difficulties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I can&rsquo;t help you,&rdquo; the editor said coldly.
&ldquo;Do drop in again sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door for her, a pointed hint that she
was to go.</p>
<p>As she stepped out into the outer waiting room, a
man who evidently expected to see the editor, arose.
He had entered the outer office only a few minutes
before, and this was the first time that Penny had seen
him. Upon recognizing him, she stopped short, for
it was Webb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go in now, Mr. Nelson,&rdquo; the secretary
told Webb.</p>
<p>Bestowing a sneering smile upon her, he entered the
private office.</p>
<p>Then the door closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>A NOTE FROM BEN</i></h2>
<p>After Webb had gone into Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s office,
Penny debated her next action. Could Webb and
Cordell be friends? Or was this merely a business
call? In any case, the two men were obviously of such
different type and personality that she failed to understand
what basis there might be for a friendship.</p>
<p>Deciding she could accomplish nothing by waiting
and questioning Mr. Cordell, she left the office. As
she passed down the corridor, an open window at its
far end, drew her attention.</p>
<p>Pausing for an instant, she glanced out upon the
rooftop of the <i>Riverview Star</i> building. The tin
flooring, only a few feet below the level of the sill,
easily could be reached by anyone climbing through
the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Tempted to take a short cut to the office, Penny
impulsively stepped through the opening. From the
rooftop she could see the city spread out below in
rigid pattern, and to the eastward, the winding river.</p>
<p>Crossing the dusty floor to the skylight above the
<i>Star</i> photography room, Penny peered curiously
down. No one was visible below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if a person really could get through that
skylight,&rdquo; she speculated. &ldquo;It would be quite a feat,
but I believe it could be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A star athlete in high school, Penny felt a challenge.
Giving no thought to her clothes, she squeezed
through the narrow opening and snagged her sweater.
As she freed herself, she noticed a tiny bit of blue
cloth that had impaled itself on the nail.</p>
<p>The cloth was not from Penny&rsquo;s garments, and
looked as if it might have been torn from a man&rsquo;s wool
suit. Freeing it from the nail, she slipped it into her
pocket for later examination.</p>
<p>Now, with her feet dangling into space, she considered
how she was to get down into the room below.
No longer was it possible to swing from the
opening to the top of a filing cabinet, for Salt had
carefully moved the heavy case to the far side of the
room.</p>
<p>Seizing the skylight chain, Penny swung downward.
The tiny brass rings cut into her hands and
half-way down, she was forced to let go, dropping
to the floor with a loud thump.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>From the inner photography room came a terrified
scream. Elda Hunt, her face white with fear, appeared
in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed, recovering from the shock
of Penny&rsquo;s unexpected entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take it easy, Elda,&rdquo; Penny advised, brushing
dirt from her sweater. &ldquo;I was only experimenting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experimenting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to see if it would be possible for a person
to get into this room through the skylight. It is
possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; Elda commented sarcastically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you were the one who pulled that stunt in
the first place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo; Penny was irritated. Not wishing
to discuss the matter, she turned and walked out
of the photography room.</p>
<p>In the corridor she met Salt Sommers who stopped
her to ask when they were to visit Professor Bettenridge
in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock tonight, if you&rsquo;re willing to go,&rdquo;
Penny said eagerly. &ldquo;I very much want to see the
professor demonstrate his ray machine for Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I want to find out what became of my camera,&rdquo;
Salt added grimly. &ldquo;Is it a date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then suppose we start right after dinner. Can
you meet me here at seven o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it a little earlier,&rdquo; Penny suggested.
&ldquo;I have a hunch that by getting there before the start
of the demonstration we may learn more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; agreed Salt. &ldquo;Make it six-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having over-stayed her lunch hour, Penny quickly
washed her grimy hands and returned to her desk.
As she sat down at the typewriter, she noticed a sealed
letter thrust behind the roller. Addressed to her,
the writing was in a bold scrawl she did not recognize.</p>
<p>Curiously, she scanned the message. It was written
on cheap tablet paper and had been signed with Ben
Bartell&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See me if you can,&rdquo; was all it said. &ldquo;I have a little
information about the <i>Snark</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tucking the note into her pocketbook, Penny began
to plan how she could visit Ben that day. She
would not be off until five o&rsquo;clock, and she had promised
to meet Salt at six-thirty. If she were to get any
dinner and see Ben at the waterfront, it would mean
fast stepping.</p>
<p>Only by an effort of will could Penny keep her
mind on the work before her. There were rewrites
to do, and an interesting feature. At four-thirty with
two stories yet to be done, she became panicky that
she could not finish on time. But by really digging
in, she completed the stories exactly on the dot of
five, and with a tired sigh of relief, dropped them into
Editor DeWitt&rsquo;s wire copy basket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just like a trained race horse, Penny,&rdquo; he
said jokingly. &ldquo;But your work is okay. You&rsquo;re improving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny brightened at the praise, for Editor DeWitt
was not given to complimentary words as a rule.
Hurriedly washing carbon paper stains from her
hands, she caught a bus which took her within a block
of Ben&rsquo;s shack.</p>
<p>Smoke curled from the chimney, and as she
thumped on the sagging door, she detected the odor
of cooking bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in!&rdquo; Ben greeted her heartily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time to share my supper. You got my
note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, Ben. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without answering, the former reporter stepped
aside for her to enter. The room was much cleaner
than when Penny last had visited it. Ben looked better
too. Although his clothes remained unpressed, his
hair had been cut, and there was a brightness to his
eyes which she instantly noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found work?&rdquo; she surmised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd jobs,&rdquo; Ben answered briefly. &ldquo;After talking
to you I made up my mind I&rsquo;d better snap out of it.
If I can&rsquo;t find newspaper work, I&rsquo;ll try something
else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking&mdash;&rdquo; Penny sat down in a rickety
chair, &ldquo;&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t you do free lance work? Write
stories for newspapers out of town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without a typewriter? I put mine in hock months
ago, and it finally was sold for charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a typewriter at home, Ben. I&rsquo;ll lend it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s face brightened, but he hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sure
been lost without a machine,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;But I
hate to take yours. You know what happened to my
watch. This shack isn&rsquo;t safe. Anyone might come
in here and steal it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only an old typewriter, Ben. I&rsquo;m willing to
take a chance. I&rsquo;ll see that you get the machine within
a day or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former reporter stepped to the stove to turn
the bacon. He kept his face averted as he said:
&ldquo;Penny, you&rsquo;ve been a real friend&mdash;the only one.
That day when you met me&mdash;well, I didn&rsquo;t give a
darn. I was only one step from walking off a dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such things, Ben!&rdquo; Penny warned.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a run of hard luck, but it&rsquo;s changing
now. Suppose you tell me what you learned about
the <i>Snark</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing too startling, so don&rsquo;t get your hopes up,&rdquo;
Ben grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>He set out two cracked plates on the battered table,
two cups for coffee, and then dished up the bacon and
a few fried potatoes. It was a meagre supper, but not
for the world would Penny have offended Ben by refusing
to share it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me about the <i>Snark</i>,&rdquo; she urged again, as
Ben poured the coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching the boat at night, Penny.
Queer things go on there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suspected that after seeing Webb pitched
overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of men come and go from that vessel,&rdquo;
Ben resumed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch they couldn&rsquo;t all be
employed on her, because the <i>Snark</i> has been out of
service for months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the <i>Snark</i> is being used as a meeting place&mdash;that&rsquo;s
obvious. Just for the fun of it, I sneaked aboard
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you learn, Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men were having a confab in one of the cabins.
I couldn&rsquo;t hear much, but enough to gather that
they are afraid Webb will talk to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what, Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t learn that part. I aim to keep tab on the
place for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny told of seeing Webb that afternoon and also
of his association with Professor Bettenridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A secret ray machine, my eye!&rdquo; Ben exploded.
&ldquo;You may be sure it&rsquo;s a fake if Webb has anything
to do with it! Penny, this is no business for you to be
mixed up in. Webb is a dock rat and as surly an egg
as I ever met. You ought to give him a wide berth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly be careful,&rdquo; Penny promised, arising.
&ldquo;Sorry to leave you with the dishes, Ben, but I must
run or I&rsquo;ll be late for another appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She really hated to go, for she saw that her companionship
had made the young man more cheerful.
Ben walked with her through the waterfront district,
and then reluctantly said goodbye.</p>
<p>Hastening along the shadowy street, Penny noticed
the large electric sign on top of the Gables Hotel.</p>
<p>Impulsively, she stopped at the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Navy official Professor Bettenridge spoke
of may have arrived,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Just to make
certain, I&rsquo;ll inquire again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>THE DEMONSTRATION</i></h2>
<p>Penny was due to meet Salt Sommers in ten minutes,
but if she were late, she knew he would not leave
without her.</p>
<p>Entering the crowded hotel, she waited her turn
at the desk and then inquired if any Navy officers had
registered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge,&rdquo; the clerk replied, consulting
the register. &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ve not had a Navy man in
for at least a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any Army officers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last was a sergeant who checked out two
weeks ago. Most of our guests rent on a monthly
basis. We have only a few rooms for transient
guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me if a Professor Bettenridge has
called here in the last few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while I&rsquo;ve been at the desk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>The information convinced Penny she had not misjudged
the professor. She now was satisfied he never
had arranged with Navy officers to inspect his ray
machine. Instead, he had misinformed Mr. Johnson,
no doubt hoping to impress him that others were interested
in the invention.</p>
<p>Quickly leaving the hotel, Penny hastened on to
the news office. As she passed near the loading platform,
Salt hailed her from a car parked there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Penny slid into the front seat beside him, apologizing
for being late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; returned Salt, shifting into gear.
&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t much time unless we hurry. You
know the way, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do by daylight. And I think I can find the farmhouse,
even if it should get dark before we reach
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt was a fast and very skillful driver. He chose
the less frequented streets and soon they were in the
open. They made excellent time, reaching their destination
just as it began to grow dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall we explain to the professor?&rdquo; Penny
inquired dubiously as the photographer parked the
car under an oak tree along the highway. &ldquo;He may
think it strange that I returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him,&rdquo; said Salt, unconcerned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to
get my camera.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go at him too hard,&rdquo; Penny pleaded. &ldquo;After
all, there is a chance I was mistaken about the license
number. In my excitement the night of the explosion,
I may have remembered a wrong figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Salt acknowledged gloomily. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not pretend we&rsquo;re here to get a feature story
for the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo; Penny suggested impulsively. &ldquo;That
way, I could ask him all the questions I like about the
secret ray machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way you want to do it,&rdquo; Salt agreed amiably.</p>
<p>He locked the car and they walked to the farmhouse.
Learning that the professor and his wife were
at the lake, they trudged down the lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Penny suddenly warned in a whisper.</p>
<p>Clutching Salt&rsquo;s arm, she drew him into the shadow
of a tree. At first he could not understand the need
for caution. Then as Penny pointed, he saw a
hunched figure with a lighted lantern, walking along
the lake shore away from the cabin where Professor
Bettenridge&rsquo;s ray machine was kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes Webb now!&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
evidently going to the shack where the mines are
stored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he carrying?&rdquo; Salt inquired.</p>
<p>Although too far away to see plainly, they thought
that he had a small satchel tucked under his arm. As
he drew closer they discerned that it was leather, and
apparently used as a container for a long cylinder-shaped
object.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Passing a short distance away, the man did not see
Salt or Penny. They watched until they saw the red
glow of his lantern vanish over a hillock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the foot-path to the shack where the mines
are stored,&rdquo; Penny commented. &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s
inside the satchel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we try to find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk to Professor Bettenridge first,&rdquo; Penny
proposed, going down the lane.</p>
<p>The door of the cabin stood slightly ajar. Inside
the lighted room were the professor, his wife, Mr.
Johnson, and several other persons Penny had never
seen before. However, she took them to be town
residents who had heard of the test and were eager
to see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, professor,&rdquo; they heard Mr. Johnson say
jovially. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all here, so why not go ahead?
Show us what the machine will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time, all in good time,&rdquo; the professor
rejoined. &ldquo;You must give my assistant an opportunity
to drop the mine into the lake. He will signal us by
lantern when he is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tapped on the door. The professor whirled
around, decidedly startled. Then, observing Salt and
Penny, he abruptly came over to speak to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked in a tone which was not friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came to see the demonstration,&rdquo; Penny said
brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to have you,&rdquo; the professor replied, though
without cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to write a feature story about your machine
too,&rdquo; Penny continued. &ldquo;For the newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The request displeased the professor. Scowling, he
said curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, but there must be no publicity at this
time&mdash;orders of the Navy, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Navy is interested in buying your machine?&rdquo;
Penny asked, hoping to lead him on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deal is concluded except for my signature,&rdquo;
the professor said, darting a quick glance at Mr. Johnson.
&ldquo;I should have signed at once, but I promised
Mr. Johnson first chance to buy the machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the Navy men are in town now?&rdquo; Penny
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Gables Hotel?&rdquo; Penny pursued the subject.</p>
<p>The professor looked at her sharply, for the first
time suspecting that she was inducing him to reveal
far too much.</p>
<p>Without answering, he turned his back, and began
to talk to Mr. Johnson about technical details of the
machine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am convinced it is a wonderful invention,&rdquo; the
latter declared. &ldquo;But before I invest $200,000, I must
be absolutely certain that it will do everything you
claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not be disappointed,&rdquo; reassured the professor.
&ldquo;Only be patient for a few minutes, and you
will witness a demonstration that will convince you
beyond a shadow of a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignored by the professor and his wife, Penny and
Salt did not enter the cabin. Instead, they walked a
short distance away to discuss their next move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The demonstration won&rsquo;t start for a few minutes,&rdquo;
the photographer said. &ldquo;Suppose we ankle down to
the lake and find out what Webb is doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeding down the path which led around the
lake shore, they soon sighted the man&rsquo;s glowing lantern.
He had set it down on the ground while he
trundled out one of the heavy mines from the shack.
As they watched from a distance, he loaded it into a
boat, picked up the lantern, and slowly rowed out
into the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently he&rsquo;s going to drop it overboard for the
test,&rdquo; Salt said. &ldquo;While he&rsquo;s out there, let&rsquo;s take a
look in the shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried the door. It was locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s done, but I&rsquo;m sure those
mines are doctored in some way,&rdquo; Penny declared.
&ldquo;Louise and I saw Webb working on one when we
were here yesterday, but what he did I couldn&rsquo;t
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll learn nothing here,&rdquo; Salt said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
back to the cabin and see how the professor pulls off
the demonstration. Apparently he has Mr. Johnson
two-thirds convinced already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t get into an argument
with the professor about your camera until after the
test,&rdquo; Penny pleaded as they started up the slope again.
&ldquo;I want to watch the demonstration. If you accuse
him of deliberately keeping the camera, he may throw
us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; Salt promised.</p>
<p>Reaching the cabin, the pair became instantly aware
of a tenseness in the attitude of the professor and his
wife. Although they did not tell the newcomers they
were unwelcome, it was evident by their expressions
that they distrusted Penny and Salt.</p>
<p>Professor Bettenridge stood behind his machine, explaining
its many parts to the awed spectators. Penny
could make nothing of the technical jargon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The demonstration will soon start,&rdquo; the professor
declared, looking at his watch. &ldquo;I will turn on the
motors now, as they must heat for several minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned several switches and the room was filled
with a low humming sound. Two tiny lights buried
deep in the complicated mechanism began to glow a
cherry red. The professor bent low over the machine,
frowning thoughtfully. He adjusted three of
the concave mirrors, and switched on another motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Despite a dubious attitude, Penny found herself becoming
deeply impressed. Was it possible, she wondered,
that she had misjudged the professor and his
machine? She dismissed the thought. The mine
never would explode unless it had been tampered with&mdash;she
was certain of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch closely now,&rdquo; the professor directed. &ldquo;At
any moment my assistant will signal with his lantern
that he has dropped the mine and is safely away from
the area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor&rsquo;s wife had gone to the doorway.
Tensely she watched the lake. Minutes passed. Then
from out on the water, there came a moving circle of
red&mdash;the signal from Webb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>Everyone in the little cabin held his breath. Dramatically,
Professor Bettenridge took a metal tuning
fork and struck it sharply against the crystal ball in
the center of his machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take a moment for the sound to reach the
lake,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;But only a moment. Watch
closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All persons in the room crowded to the door and
the windows. Suddenly a huge burst of flame appeared
on the lake, fanning out on the surface of the
water. A moment later came the dull boom of a terrific
explosion.</p>

<br /><i>SUSPICION</i></h2>
<p>Everyone who witnessed the spectacular demonstration
was awed by the sight of the flames rising
above the lake. As they died away, Professor Bettenridge,
strutting a bit, walked back to his machine
and covered it with the canvas hood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now are you satisfied?&rdquo; he inquired triumphantly.
&ldquo;Is there anyone here who doubts the remarkable possibilities
of my invention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fine demonstration! Magnificent!&rdquo; approved
Mr. Johnson, fairly beside himself with excitement.
&ldquo;I am convinced of the machine&rsquo;s worth
and if we can agree upon terms I will write you a
check tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Bettenridge&rsquo;s expression did not change,
but the brief glance he flashed his wife was not lost
upon Penny or Salt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You understand, of course,&rdquo; he said smoothly,
&ldquo;that the Navy probably will insist upon ultimate
purchase of the machine even if I relinquish ownership?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Johnson. &ldquo;I should expect
to make such a sale. The machine would have no
practical use except in warfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was tempted to ask the man if he considered
it patriotic to try to obtain control of a machine in
the hope of selling it to the government at a high profit
to himself. But she wisely remained silent.</p>
<p>Salt, however, had a few pointed remarks to offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that if this invention
is so remarkable, the Navy hasn&rsquo;t already snapped it
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Bettenridge froze him with a glance.
&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said cuttingly, &ldquo;you evidently do
not understand how government business is conducted.
Negotiations take months to complete. My
wife and I need cash, so for that reason, we are willing
to sell the machine quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I understood you to say that Navy men
were ready to complete the deal,&rdquo; Penny interposed
innocently. &ldquo;Did they change their minds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; Professor Bettenridge&rsquo;s dark eyes
flashed, and only by great effort did he maintain control
of his temper. &ldquo;You understand that while their
recommendation would eventually be acted upon, a
sale still would take many months to complete.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will your machine explode mines on land as well
as in the water?&rdquo; Salt inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not give us a land demonstration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us!&rdquo; the professor mocked, his patience at an end.
&ldquo;Young man, you were not invited here, and I might
add that your presence irritates me! Are you in any
way associated with Mr. Johnson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then kindly do not inject yourself into our negotiations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young man raises an interesting point,&rdquo; Mr.
Johnson interposed, frowning thoughtfully. &ldquo;Perhaps
we should have a land demonstration before I pay
over the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you doubt my honesty?&rdquo; the professor demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. It&rsquo;s only that I must be very careful
before I purchase such an expensive machine. I must
satisfy myself that it will do everything you claim
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have just witnessed a successful demonstration.
What more do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A successful water test,&rdquo; Salt remarked softly,
&ldquo;does not necessarily mean a successful land test.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should have a land test,&rdquo; Mr. Johnson
decided. &ldquo;If you convince me that the machine will
work equally well under such circumstances, I will
write the check instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A land test is impossible,&rdquo; the professor said stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dangers are too great. Windows would be
smashed for many miles around. Authorities would
not permit such a test. Only with the greater difficulty
did I obtain permission to discharge the mines
under water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not thought of that,&rdquo; Mr. Johnson acknowledged.
He hesitated, and it was evident that in another
moment he would decide to purchase the machine
without further tests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson, I suppose you have witnessed tests
made with your own mines,&rdquo; Penny interposed. &ldquo;Or
have they all been made with those supplied by the
professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark infuriated Mr. and Mrs. Bettenridge,
as she had expected it would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and this young man are trying to discredit my
machine!&rdquo; he exclaimed wrathfully. &ldquo;Please leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; agreed Penny, but made no move
to depart.</p>
<p>Seeds of suspicion already had been implanted in
Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady is right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should request
a test on a mine which I provide myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; snapped the professor. &ldquo;The machine
will work equally well on any mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then surely you should not object to one further
test?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The delay is unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain I can provide a mine within two days,&rdquo;
insisted Mr. Johnson. &ldquo;Suppose we set the next test
for Thursday night at this same hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus trapped, Professor Bettenridge could not refuse
without losing the sale. Scowling, he gave in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. But this will be the final demonstration.
If you are not satisfied Thursday night, the
deal is off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p>Bowing to the Bettenridges, he departed. Others
who had witnessed the demonstration began to melt
away. Only Salt and Penny remained.</p>
<p>Professor Bettenridge closed the door so that the
conversation would not be overheard. Then he turned
angrily to the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s your little game?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;You deliberately tried to queer my sale? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson seems like such an innocent little
rabbit, maybe we thought he ought to be protected,&rdquo;
Salt drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protected! Why, he&rsquo;s being given the opportunity
of a lifetime! How much is it worth to you to
keep out of my affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cent,&rdquo; Salt retorted. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any
part of your deal. But there&rsquo;s something I did come
here for&mdash;my camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told the young lady I know nothing
about it. If you were stupid enough to throw it into
a passing automobile, then you deserve to lose it.
Now get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt was tempted to argue the matter, but Penny
took his arm, pulling him toward the door. The professor
slammed it hard behind them as they went out
into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow is a crook!&rdquo; Salt exploded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a
cookie he has my camera too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t prove it,&rdquo; Penny sighed. &ldquo;After
all, we did act in a high-handed way. We may have
queered his sale to Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good thing if we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have no proof the machine is a fake. With
our own eyes we saw the mine explode. Of course,
we think Webb tampered with it in some fashion, but
we&rsquo;re not certain of that either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proof of the pudding will come Thursday
night when and if the old boy explodes Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just clever enough to do it, too,&rdquo; Penny said
gloomily.</p>
<p>The couple had walked only a short distance up
the lane when they were startled to hear a shrill
whistle in the darkness. It came from the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Halting, they waited. In a moment the sound was
repeated. Then to their surprise, came an answering
whistle from inside Professor Bettenridge&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Webb,&rdquo; Salt whispered, observing
a shadowy form approaching. &ldquo;The whistle evidently
is a signal to make certain the coast is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they watched, the hunched figure emerged from
the darkness, was silhouetted momentarily in the light
which came from the cabin, then disappeared inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we knew what they were talking about in
there,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;It might clear up some of the
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not see what we can learn?&rdquo; proposed Salt.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking care to walk softly, the pair stole back to
the cabin. Crouching by the window, they could
hear a low murmur of voices inside. At first it was difficult
to catch the trend of the conversation, but
gradually Professor Bettenridge&rsquo;s voice grew louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it any better than you do,&rdquo; Salt and
Penny heard him say, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s the way it is. If
we&rsquo;re to finish the deal, we&rsquo;ve got to explode one of
Johnson&rsquo;s mines Thursday night. The question is,
can we do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends on the type of mine,&rdquo; Webb replied
gruffly. &ldquo;How soon can we have it ahead of the
test?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll insist that he deliver it here at least by afternoon.
Will that give you time enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it won&rsquo;t take more than a half hour to fix &rsquo;er
for the test, providing it can be done. But I ain&rsquo;t
makin&rsquo; no promises until I see the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chance we have to take,&rdquo; Professor Bettenridge
said. &ldquo;The deal would have gone through tonight
if it hadn&rsquo;t been for a couple of young newspaper
fools who came nosing around here. They may
make us trouble Thursday night too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t aimin&rsquo; to get mixed with the police,&rdquo; Webb
said uneasily. &ldquo;If this deal don&rsquo;t go through Thursday
night, I&rsquo;m quitting. We&rsquo;re in a mighty risky business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we stand to make at least $200,000,&rdquo; the professor
reminded him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a third cut. If
Johnson holds off Thursday night, I&rsquo;ll drop to $100,000.
The thing we&rsquo;ve got to do is to pull off that test
okay and clear out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Salt had heard enough to be certain that
the men with whom they were dealing were crooks
of the first rank. Slipping noiselessly away, they
trudged to the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do we do?&rdquo; Penny questioned. &ldquo;Notify
the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could,&rdquo; Salt debated, &ldquo;but so far, it&rsquo;s only our
word against Professor Bettenridge&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;d probably
convince the police he was only a crack-pot inventor
who thought he had a wonderful machine. They
might let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any other ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A slick trick would be to fix that mine so it won&rsquo;t
explode. That automatically would cause complications
and probably delay the deal with Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how do you propose to fix Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s
mine?&rdquo; Penny inquired. &ldquo;It would take some doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mines are all kept in that shack on the beach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Louise and I saw Webb working on one of
them there. Evidently it was the one the professor
exploded tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have doctored it in some special way.
Probably an untampered mine won&rsquo;t explode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll fix Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s mine the same way, and
then the test will appear successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt nodded gloomily. He was lost in thought for
several minutes, and then he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I have an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer switched on the car ignition.
&ldquo;Wait until Thursday night,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Can you
get away from the office early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I really shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that part,&rdquo; Salt said briskly. &ldquo;Just
sit tight, Penny. You and I will have some fun out of
this affair yet, and maybe we&rsquo;ll save Mr. Johnson a tidy
sum of money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>MAJOR BRYAN</i></h2>
<p>It was nearly midnight by the time Penny reached
home. Mrs. Weems had gone to bed, but a light
still burned in the study where Mr. Parker was working
on a speech he expected to deliver the following
day before the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you finally decided to come home,&rdquo;
he remarked severely. &ldquo;Since my little daughter became
Tillie the Toiler, she seems to have developed
independent hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until you hear where I&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; Penny said,
sinking into an easy chair beside his desk. &ldquo;Dad, you
won&rsquo;t blame me for staying out late when I tell you
what I saw and heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly she related all that had occurred, and was
pleased to note that the story interested her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more about Professor Bettenridge,&rdquo; he
urged. &ldquo;Describe him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He looks very scholarly, but his language doesn&rsquo;t
fit the part,&rdquo; Penny recalled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s tall and thin and
his nose is very pointed. Middle aged, which might
mean forty-five or maybe fifty. That&rsquo;s about all I
noticed except that he has a quick way of darting his
eyes about. And he wears glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your description, he sounds like the same
person I heard about this afternoon,&rdquo; Mr. Parker commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone told you of his experiments at the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the contrary. An Army officer, Major Alfred
Bryan called at my office this afternoon, seeking
information about a man who may be Professor Bettenridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he interested in buying the machine for the
Army, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker dipped his pen in ink, wrote a few lines,
and then looked up again. &ldquo;No, Major Bryan was
sent here to trace a man who has several charges
against him. At one time he impersonated an officer
and in recent months has been swindling persons by
various schemes. He pretends to sell Army or Navy
surplus war goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like Professor Bettenridge,
Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but from your description it could
be the same man. This secret ray machine business
sounds phoney to me. Most crooks try more than one
game&mdash;the mine exploding trick may be his latest
scheme to fleece gullible victims.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we should report the professor to
the police, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be a better idea to send Major Bryan to
see him,&rdquo; Mr. Parker returned thoughtfully. &ldquo;If the
professor should prove to be the man he&rsquo;s after, then
the Army would take over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Major Bryan now, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mention the name of his hotel, because
at the time he called at my office, I had no thought I
could assist him in any way. However, he expected
to stay in Riverview several days. It shouldn&rsquo;t be so
hard to trace him. I&rsquo;ll get busy tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tired from her adventures of the night, Penny soon
went to bed. The next day Mr. DeWitt gave her several
interesting assignments, and when one of the
stories appeared in the final edition of the <i>Star</i>, it bore
a neat little &ldquo;By Penny Parker,&rdquo; under the headline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting on in the world, I see,&rdquo; Elda Hunt observed
sarcastically.</p>
<p>Not even the unkind remark could dull Penny&rsquo;s
pleasure. She had earned her way on the newspaper
by hard, routine work. The by-line meant that she
had turned in an excellent well-written story. Elda,
whose writing lacked crispness and originality, only
once had seen her own name appear in the <i>Star</i>.
Penny felt a trifle sorry for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fairness around here,&rdquo; Elda complained
in a whine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked over a year. What do I
have to show for it? Not even a raise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not try to tell the girl it was her own
fault, that her attitude toward her work was entirely
wrong. Elda must learn for herself.</p>
<p>Not until Wednesday did Penny have a chance to
ask her father if he had traced Major Bryan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, the matter slipped my mind,&rdquo;
he confessed ruefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had one conference after
another all day long. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll certainly try to
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny reminded him of his promise on the following
day. Mr. Parker, after telephoning several places,
found the major registered at the St. Regis Hotel, not
far from the Parker home. However, the army officer
had left for the day, and was not expected to return
before nightfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; fretted Penny, &ldquo;that may be too late.
If Professor Bettenridge is successful in his demonstration
tonight, he may rake in Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s money
and skip town before the major even sees him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unlikely the professor will leave without cashing
the check, Penny. And banks will not be open until
nine o&rsquo;clock tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel safer to have police take over,&rdquo; Penny
sighed. &ldquo;If only we could prove charges against Bettenridge!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t swindled anyone yet,&rdquo; her father reminded
her. &ldquo;Learn what you can tonight, and if the
sale goes through, we&rsquo;ll then turn him over to the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be too late then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; smiled her father. &ldquo;You always were
a little impatient, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly Penny awaited the arrival of evening and
another adventure at Blue Hole Lake. She and Salt
arranged to leave the office at four o&rsquo;clock, hoping to
reach the farmhouse early enough to observe what
preparations Webb made for exploding Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s
mine.</p>
<p>But at three, Salt was sent on an important assignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back as soon as I can,&rdquo; he promised Penny,
pausing beside her desk. &ldquo;I may be a little late, but
we&rsquo;ll still make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right here waiting,&rdquo; Penny grinned.</p>
<p>At ten minutes past four Salt returned. Thinking
he might have pictures to develop before he would
be free to leave, Penny did not rush him by going back
to the photography room right away. When she had
typed her last story of the day and brought it to the
editor&rsquo;s desk for inspection, she gathered up her purse
and hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving early, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Elda inquired in a loud
voice so that everyone would notice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Penny replied, without explaining
her special mission.</p>
<p>Not wishing to leave the city without ample funds,
she first went downstairs to cash a pay check at the
company treasurer&rsquo;s window. He gave her the crisp
five dollar bills, joking with her about skipping town
with so much money.</p>
<p>Penny tucked the bills into her purse and was turning
to go back upstairs again, when through the window
she saw a man coming down the alley from the
rear of the <i>Star</i> building. Recognizing him as Mr.
McClusky, the deep sea diver she had assisted, she
darted to the window and rapped to attract his attention.</p>
<p>Not hearing her, he walked hurriedly on, and was
lost in the crowd of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what he was doing here?&rdquo; she thought as
she slowly climbed the stairs. &ldquo;Perhaps he came to
see me. But in that case, he probably would have
come up the front way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dismissing the matter from her mind, she sought
Salt in the photography room. The outside gallery
was empty, though the photographer&rsquo;s hat and coat
hung on a hook by the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt!&rdquo; she called, thinking he must be in the darkroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>No one answered. Nevertheless, a strange feeling
Penny could not have explained, took possession of
her. She sensed a presence somewhere near as if she
were being watched.</p>
<p>Nervously Penny stepped to the door of the darkroom.
She tapped lightly on it, but there was no
answer.</p>
<p>Suddenly fearful, she jerked open the door and
groped for a light. As the tiny room blazed with illumination,
she uttered a startled gasp.</p>
<p>Almost at her feet, cheek against the floor, lay Salt
Sommers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>A SECOND TEST</i></h2>
<p>As Penny knelt beside Salt, he stirred slightly and
raised a hand to his head. She saw then that there was
a tiny break in the skin which also was slightly discolored.
Either the photographer had fallen or he had
been slugged.</p>
<p>Before she could go for help, he sat up, staring at
her in a bewildered manner. Penny assisted him to a
chair, and dampening a handkerchief with water
from the tap above the developer trays, applied it to
his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; she inquired anxiously when
Salt seemed able to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slugged,&rdquo; he answered in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. The fellow must have been in the
darkroom when I came here to develop my films.
Fact is, I thought I heard someone moving around. I
stepped to the door to see, and bing! That&rsquo;s the last I
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has anything been taken, I wonder?&rdquo; Switching
on another light, Penny glanced over the room. The
drawer of a filing cabinet where old films, and plates
were kept, remained open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone may have been looking in there!&rdquo; she
commented. &ldquo;Salt, whoever he is, he must be searching
for a film he is afraid we&rsquo;ll publish in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Salt agreed, holding a hand to his
throbbing forehead. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know of any picture
we have that would damage anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stepped to the doorway of the darkroom. In
the larger room, the skylight remained closed. It was
impossible to tell if anyone had entered the building in
that way.</p>
<p>Some distance down the hall was a seldom-used
stairway which led to the roof. Finding a door opening
into it, Penny climbed the steps to look about.
The rooftop was deserted, but in the building directly
across from the <i>Star</i>, a corridor window remained
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How easy it would be for a man to step out onto
the roof from there,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If the skylight or
the stairway door were unlocked, he easily could
enter the <i>Star</i> photography room without being seen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Across the way, in the adjoining building, a man
stood at an office window, watching Penny curiously.
Sun glared on the panes so his face was distorted.
But from the location of the window, she felt certain
it was Mr. Cordell.</p>
<p>After a moment, Penny turned and went back down
the stairs. The exit at its base was barred by a door
with a rusty key in the lock.</p>
<p>Passing through, Penny locked it, and slipped the
key into her purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should stop our prowler for a few days,&rdquo;
she thought.</p>
<p>In the photography room again, she checked the
skylight, and finding it locked, was convinced that
this time the mysterious visitor had entered the building
by means of the stairs. She knew the door was
usually kept locked, but undoubtedly the janitor had
been careless.</p>
<p>By this time Salt was feeling much better. While
Penny waited, he explained to the editor why the
photos would not be ready until morning, then declared
he was ready to start for Blue Hole Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really feel like going?&rdquo; Penny asked
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; the photographer insisted. &ldquo;It takes
more than a little tap on the head to put me out of
running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt walked a trifle unsteadily as they went down
the back stairs together, but once they were in the
press car, he seemed his usual jovial self.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me about that plan of yours for tonight,&rdquo;
Penny urged as they jounced along the country road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much of a plan,&rdquo; the photographer confessed
ruefully. &ldquo;First, we&rsquo;ve got to learn exactly
what Webb does to those mines to make them explode.
Then somehow we&rsquo;ll have to undo the work to cause
the demonstration to turn out a flop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a big order,&rdquo; Penny sighed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
need plenty of luck to carry it out. Especially as
we&rsquo;re arriving rather late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having no intention of announcing their presence,
the pair drew up about a quarter of a mile from the
lake, parking in a side road.</p>
<p>Shadows were casting long arms over the ground as
they started hurriedly across the fields toward the
beach. They had covered two thirds of the distance
when Penny suddenly caught Salt&rsquo;s arm, pointing toward
the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There they are now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out on the lake a barge-type boat was being
steered toward the beach near the shack where Professor
Bettenridge stored the mines. The watching
couple recognized three persons aboard the craft, the
professor, Mr. Johnson and Webb. The barge also
bore a large mine, similar in type to those Penny had
seen inside the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the mine Mr. Johnson is supplying
for the test tonight,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Hand in hand, Penny and Salt crept closer to the
shore. The boat grated on the sand and Webb, with
the professor helping him, carried the heavy mine
toward the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the mine is to be exploded tonight, wouldn&rsquo;t it
be easier to leave it on the barge ready to drop into
the lake?&rdquo; Penny commented. &ldquo;Webb and the professor
must have a special reason for hauling it ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you have something there,&rdquo; Salt observed.
&ldquo;Obviously, they&rsquo;re going to doctor it in some way.
We&rsquo;ll see what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Webb unlocked the door of the shack and the two
men carried the mine inside. Creeping still closer to
the building, Salt and Penny heard Mr. Johnson say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute. I see you have other mines stored
here. How am I to be sure that the one exploded will
be the mine I have provided?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may mark it if you wish,&rdquo; the professor replied.
&ldquo;In fact, we prefer that you do, so there can
be no possible doubt in your mind. Take this pocket
knife and scratch your initials on the covering of the
mine. Then tonight, before it is dumped in the lake,
you may check again to see there has been no substitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand, I don&rsquo;t distrust you,&rdquo; Mr. Johnson
said, ill at ease. &ldquo;But so much money is at stake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I understand your attitude perfectly,&rdquo; the professor
replied. &ldquo;Certainly you are entitled to take
every precaution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence ensued, and Penny and Salt assumed that
Mr. Johnson was scratching his initials on the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now suppose we have dinner at the village inn,&rdquo;
the professor presently suggested. &ldquo;Then we will
have the demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we wait so long before setting off the mine?&rdquo;
Mr. Johnson inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, village authorities gave permission for the test
to be held at nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; the professor explained.
&ldquo;My own preference would be to get it over immediately,
but I dare not disobey their orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson made no reply, and a few minutes
later, the three men walked away. No sooner had
they disappeared up the lake than Penny and Salt
came out of hiding from among the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to hand it to Professor Bettenridge,&rdquo;
commented the photographer with grudging praise.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a smooth talker. I&rsquo;ll bet a frosted cookie the
test could be held at one time as well as another so far
as the village authorities are concerned. He has a
special reason for wanting it at nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably to give Webb time enough to work on
the mine or exchange them,&rdquo; Penny said, and then
frowned thoughtfully. &ldquo;But what if the machine
actually should work? After all, the professor agreed
to explode Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s mine, and apparently he&rsquo;s
marked it with his initials. It won&rsquo;t be easy to substitute
another one now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, if I&rsquo;m any good at guessing, it will be
done. Now what shall we do until nine o&rsquo;clock?
Grab ourselves something to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was about to suggest that they drive to a village
cafe, when she noticed Webb returning alone
from up the beach. Barely did the pair have time to
duck out of sight behind a boulder before he approached.</p>
<p>Walking directly to the shack, he unlocked the
door, and entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this must be where the hocus-pocus begins!&rdquo;
Salt whispered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find out what he does
to that mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise and I climbed up in that tree the other day
and looked through the glass in the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s the trick for us! Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making no sound, the pair climbed the tree close
beside the shack. Noiselessly, they inched their way
toward the skylight, and lying flat, peered down into
the dark interior.</p>
<p>Webb had lighted a lantern which he hung on a
wall nail. Unaware that he was being watched, he
squatted in front of the mine which bore Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s
initials, studying it thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Muttering to himself, he next took a powerful
ratchet drill, and for a long time worked with it on
the mine, boring a tiny but deep hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting stiff in this position,&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;What is he doing, Salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the photographer admitted, puzzled.
&ldquo;Apparently, he&rsquo;s doctoring Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s mine
so it will explode tonight, but I&rsquo;m not smart enough to
figure how the trick will be accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By now it was so dark that the pair in the tree no
longer feared they would be seen. Keeping perfectly
still, they watched the work in the room below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear why Professor Bettenridge set nine
o&rsquo;clock for the demonstration,&rdquo; Salt whispered.
&ldquo;Webb needed all this time to get the mine ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why they brought it here instead of
dumping it into the lake,&rdquo; Penny added. &ldquo;But how
can they make the mine explode at exactly the right
moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Webb had worked for a while longer, he
arose and stretched his cramped muscles. Going to a
cupboard, he removed a white powder from a glass
tube, and carefully inserted it in the hole he had just
made in the mine. As a final act, he sealed the tiny
hole with another material, and polished the surface
so that the place did not show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slick work!&rdquo; Salt commented. &ldquo;By the time he&rsquo;s
through, no one ever could tell the mine has been
touched! Certainly not that thick-skulled Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Apparently satisfied with his work, Webb put away
his tools, made a final inspection of the mine, and then
left the shack. After carefully locking the door, he
disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s our move?&rdquo; Penny asked as she and
Salt finally slid down from their uncomfortable perch.
&ldquo;Shall we tell Mr. Johnson what we just saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could, but he might not believe us. Penny, I
have a better idea! If we can get inside the shack&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s locked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skylight may be open.&rdquo; Salt climbed up on
the roof to investigate, but to his disappointment, the
roof window was tightly fastened from inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could smash the glass,&rdquo; Penny suggested dubiously.</p>
<p>Salt shook his head. &ldquo;That would give the whole
thing away. No, I think we can get inside another
way, but we&rsquo;ll have to work fast! Now that Webb
has the mine ready for the demonstration, the professor
and Mr. Johnson may show up here at any
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>THE LANTERN SIGNAL</i></h2>
<p>Salt explained that he intended to pick the lock
of the shack door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I worked the police beat, a detective taught
me this trick,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You keep watch while
I work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that Webb had disappeared no one was to be
seen near the beach. To Penny&rsquo;s relief, not a person
appeared, and Salt, working swiftly, soon had the door
open.</p>
<p>To make certain they would not be taken unawares,
Salt relocked the door on the inside. Groping about,
he found the lantern Webb had left behind, and
lighted it.</p>
<p>Three mines lay on the floor. &ldquo;Which is the right
one?&rdquo; Penny asked. &ldquo;They all look alike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s initials must be on the one Webb
tampered with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Salt turned over one of the mines, inspecting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thing might go off any minute,&rdquo; Penny said,
edging away. &ldquo;Do be careful, Salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt chuckled. &ldquo;If it should go off, we&rsquo;d never
know what hit us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is the one Webb
tampered with all right. Penny, how are you at forging?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forging?&rdquo; she repeated, not understanding what
he meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you duplicate Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s initials on another
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so. Not so it would look the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, you can,&rdquo; Salt said, thrusting his pocket knife
into her hand. &ldquo;It will be dark and no one will look
too carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you want me to do it? You mean to
substitute Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s mine for one of the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket,&rdquo; chuckled the photographer.
&ldquo;Maybe my guess is wrong, but I have a sneaking
suspicion if we use one of the professor&rsquo;s own mines, it
will fail to explode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine has to be doctored with that powder we
saw Webb use!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my theory, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But maybe the other mines have already been
treated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a possibility,&rdquo; Salt admitted thoughtfully.
&ldquo;No way of telling that, because the hole would be
covered so skillfully. We&rsquo;ll have to take a chance
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Salt held the lantern, Penny scratched Mr.
Johnson&rsquo;s initials on the metal covering of the mine.
Skilled in art, she was able to copy them fairly well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look exactly the same,&rdquo; Salt said, comparing
the two, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re good enough to get by
unless Mr. Johnson becomes very critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly they moved the two mines, placing Mr.
Johnson&rsquo;s well to the back of the room, and leaving
the substitute exactly where the other had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that job is done,&rdquo; Salt chuckled. &ldquo;Unless I
miss my guess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, startled to hear a murmur of voices
from a short distance down the beach. Quick as a
flash he blew out the lantern and hung it in its accustomed
place on the wall nail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt! Those men are coming!&rdquo; Penny whispered
fearfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trapped here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too late to slip out the door, for already the
men were very close, and unmistakably, one of the
voices was that of Professor Bettenridge.</p>
<p>The only available hiding place was a storage closet.
Barely in time, Salt and Penny squeezed into it, closing
the door and flattening themselves against the wall.</p>
<p>The door of the shack swung open to admit the
professor, Webb, and Mr. Johnson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dark as pitch in here,&rdquo; Webb muttered. &ldquo;Wait
and I&rsquo;ll light the lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment the yellow glow illuminated the dingy
little room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is my mine?&rdquo; Mr. Johnson asked. &ldquo;They
all look alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for all practical purposes they are exactly
alike,&rdquo; said the professor smoothly. &ldquo;So far as my machine
is concerned, it makes not a particle of difference.
Webb, which is the mine that Mr. Johnson
supplied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; the assistant said, tapping the one Salt
and Penny had substituted. &ldquo;See your initials, Mr.
Johnson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; agreed the man.</p>
<p>Inside the closet, Penny and Salt breathed easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get on with the demonstration,&rdquo; the professor
urged with sudden impatience. &ldquo;Load the mine onto
the boat, Webb. Go out to the center of the lake.
Then when you have dropped it, give the usual signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When everything is okay, I&rsquo;ll wave my lantern
three times,&rdquo; Webb agreed.</p>
<p>The mine was trundled out and the shack became
dark. However, Salt and Penny did not dare come
out of hiding until they heard Webb start the motor of
the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The coast is clear,&rdquo; the photographer then reported,
peering out a crack of the outer door. &ldquo;Webb
has gone, and the professor and Mr. Johnson are walking
up to the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the beach, Penny and Salt watched the boat
moving slowly across the water. Presently the craft
stopped, and the mine was heaved overboard. The
pair waited, but there was no signal from Webb. Nor
did his boat move away from the locality where the
mine had been dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he wave the lantern?&rdquo; Penny fretted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting deliberately, and for a purpose,&rdquo; Salt
declared. &ldquo;Why not amble up the hill and watch the
professor perform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; agreed Penny.</p>
<p>Walking rapidly, they arrived at the cabin quite
breathless. As they tapped lightly on the door, Professor
Bettenridge appeared visibly startled. He stiffened
to alert, guarded attention, but relaxed slightly as
his wife admitted the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you two again,&rdquo; he said none too pleasantly.
&ldquo;You are just in time to witness my final demonstration.
We are waiting now for my assistant&rsquo;s
signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to take a long while,&rdquo; Mr. Johnson commented,
glancing at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Webb may have had trouble getting the mine
overboard,&rdquo; the professor soothed. &ldquo;Besides, he has
to move out of the danger zone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Penny and Salt looked at each other but said nothing.
They were certain that Webb had been in no
haste to return to shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you two smirking about?&rdquo; the professor
demanded irritably. &ldquo;I suppose you think my machine
won&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be surprised if it does,&rdquo; Salt agreed, unruffled.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bettenridge, who stood at the window, suddenly
cried: &ldquo;There is the signal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Bettenridge snapped on a switch and the
ray machine began to hum. He turned on another
motor and lights began to glow. Then he struck the
crystal ball, producing a musical vibration.</p>
<p>Assuming a confident pose, he waited.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>As the seconds ticked by and still there was no explosion,
the professor began to wilt. He gazed desperately
at his wife who looked as dismayed as he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, something seems to be wrong. Are you
sure you saw the signal? Perhaps Webb has not yet
dropped the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the signal. The lantern was waved three
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor made several adjustments on his machine,
and again struck the musical note. But there
was no explosion. Enjoying his discomfiture, Salt and
Penny grinned from ear to ear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did something to the machine!&rdquo; the professor
accused them furiously. &ldquo;You came here and tampered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not been near this place tonight until a
moment ago,&rdquo; Penny retorted. &ldquo;The truth is, you
weren&rsquo;t able to explode Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so!&rdquo; The professor&rsquo;s face now was
red with anger. &ldquo;Something has gone wrong, but
that doesn&rsquo;t prove my machine is a failure. We&rsquo;ll
have another test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I shall be interested,&rdquo; Mr. Johnson
said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking the matter over and
there are so many hazards&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you an especially good offer,&rdquo; the professor
declared, flipping the canvas cover over his
machine. &ldquo;Furthermore, we will have the test tonight.
I guarantee to explode the mine before you
leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the mine I supplied is at the bottom of the lake
and it failed to go off,&rdquo; Mr. Johnson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, we will talk to Webb and learn exactly what
happened,&rdquo; the professor said, taking him by the arm.
&ldquo;I know there is a logical explanation for the failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glaring at Penny and Salt, he shooed everyone out
of the cabin, locking the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said to his wife, giving her a significant
look, &ldquo;take Mr. Johnson to the house while I find
Webb. I&rsquo;ll be with you in just a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The professor went hurriedly down the beach while
Mrs. Bettenridge and Mr. Johnson walked slowly
toward the rooming house. Penny and Salt remained
beside the cabin until everyone was beyond hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, our trick worked,&rdquo; Salt chuckled, &ldquo;but if we
aren&rsquo;t careful, the professor will pull off a successful
test yet and ruin all our plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Webb are certain to examine the mines
and discover the one with Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s initials still in
the shack. Then they may convince Mr. Johnson
there was a mix-up, and go ahead with another test
which will be successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do something,&rdquo; Salt muttered. &ldquo;But
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone Dad
and have him come here right away with Major
Bryan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; approved Salt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here and hold the
fort while you telephone. Tell your father to step on
the gas, because we&rsquo;ve got to move fast to queer Professor
Bettenridge&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>A CROOK EXPOSED</i></h2>
<p>Eager to carry out Salt Sommers&rsquo; bidding, Penny
ran up the hill in search of a telephone. She considered
using the one at the house where Professor and
Mrs. Bettenridge roomed, but decided against it, fearing
that the conversation might be overheard or reported
to them by the farm woman.</p>
<p>Hastening on, she saw a light farther down the road,
and recalled having noticed a house there. Five minutes
later, completely winded, she pounded on the
door. A man in shirtsleeves, the evening newspaper
in his hand, answered her knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, may I use your telephone?&rdquo; Penny gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sure,&rdquo; he agreed, stepping aside for her to
enter. &ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny knew better than to mention what was happening
at the lake. &ldquo;I want to telephone my father
in Riverview,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The phone is in the other room,&rdquo; the man said,
switching on a light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Placing the call, Penny waited impatiently for it
to be put through. She was uncertain whether her
father would be at home. If she failed to reach him,
then the only other thing was to notify the sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your party. Go ahead, please,&rdquo; came the
long distance operator&rsquo;s voice. The next moment
Penny heard her father&rsquo;s clear tones at the other end
of the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;m at Blue Hole Lake with Salt,&rdquo; she explained
hurriedly. &ldquo;Can you drive here right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; he answered, knowing from her
voice that something serious was wrong. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned plenty about Professor Bettenridge,
Dad. Unless something is done quickly, he may sell
his fake machine to Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can <i>I</i> do about it?&rdquo; the publisher asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get hold of the Major and bring him with
you?&rdquo; Penny pleaded. &ldquo;Professor Bettenridge may
be the man he&rsquo;s after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can reach him!&rdquo; Mr. Parker agreed. &ldquo;If
I have luck I&rsquo;ll be out there within twenty or thirty
minutes. I&rsquo;ll come as fast as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before hanging up the receiver, Penny gave her
father detailed instructions for reaching the lake and
told him where to park. Leaving a dollar bill to pay
for the call, she then hastened back to find Salt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>The photographer was nowhere near the cabin and
she was afraid to call his name lest she be overheard
by the Bettenridges.</p>
<p>As she stood in the shadow of the building, she
heard voices from the beach. Someone with a lighted
lantern was coming up the trail, and soon she distinguished
two figures&mdash;Professor Bettenridge and Webb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the story you&rsquo;ll have to tell Johnson,&rdquo; she
heard the professor say. &ldquo;Tell him that somehow you
got the two mines mixed up as you were loading them
onto the boat and dumped one that was never meant to
explode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he saw us load the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was dark and he may not be sure. Anyway,
the mine with Johnson&rsquo;s initials is still in the shack.
We&rsquo;ll show it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bothers me is how did the mistake happen?&rdquo;
Webb muttered. &ldquo;I know the mine I loaded on the
boat had Johnson&rsquo;s initials. It should have gone off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is onto our game, and tampered with the
mines. It may have been a trick of that newspaper
pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, we&rsquo;re in a dangerous spot. We ought
to clear out while the clearing is good. If the authorities
get onto what we&rsquo;re doing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t&mdash;at least not tonight,&rdquo; the professor
said confidently. &ldquo;The sheriff is as dumb as they
come, and is convinced I am a genius second only to
Thomas Edison. We&rsquo;ll have to pull off a successful
test tonight with Johnson&rsquo;s mine, collect what we can,
and clear out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Webb agreed, &ldquo;but this is my last job.
The game is too dangerous. I served one stretch in
the pen and I don&rsquo;t look forward to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can explode Johnson&rsquo;s mine tonight, we&rsquo;ll
collect the money and be away from here as soon as
we cash the check. Can you pull off the job without
any blunder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I can unless someone tampers with the mine!
This time I&rsquo;ll make sure they don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; the professor agreed. &ldquo;Now I want you
to talk to Johnson. Put up a good story, and get him
to look at the mine that has his initials on it. If he refuses,
we&rsquo;re licked, but it&rsquo;s worth a final try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find the guy who broke into the shack!&rdquo;
Webb muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may have time for that later. Just now our
most important job is to convince Johnson we have
something to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men now were very close. Penny flattened
herself against the building wall, fearful of being
seen. The light from their lantern illuminated her for
an instant, but the men were so absorbed in their discussion,
they failed to see her. Going on up the hillside
path, they vanished into the farmhouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>What had become of Salt, Penny did not know.
Thinking he might have gone down to the lake, she
walked rapidly in that direction. As she approached
the shack where the mines were stored, she heard a
low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Salt?&rdquo; she called softly.</p>
<p>He came from behind a clump of bushes to join
her. Quickly they compared notes. Salt had overheard
no conversation, but he had watched Professor
Bettenridge and Webb as they reexamined the mines
in the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re onto our game, and it won&rsquo;t work twice,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to delay the test, but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we could cut the boat loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A capital idea!&rdquo; Salt approved, chuckling. &ldquo;Penny,
you really have a brain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they scurried over the stones to the water&rsquo;s edge,
Penny suddenly stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; Salt said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An automobile stopped by the roadside. I&rsquo;m sure
of it. Maybe it&rsquo;s my father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have reached here so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Dad,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. &ldquo;He
drives like the wind. It certainly sounded like the
engine of our car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look before we cut the boat loose,&rdquo;
Salt said, slipping a knife back into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Penny offered. &ldquo;You wait here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Before Salt could stop her, she darted away into the
darkness. Crawling under a barbed wire fence, she
took a short cut to the road. Even before she saw the
car, she heard a voice which she recognized as her
father&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; she called softly.</p>
<p>He was with another man whom Penny hoped was
Major Bryan. As the two came toward the fence,
she saw that it was indeed the Army officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, how did you get here so quickly?&rdquo; she greeted
him. &ldquo;Salt and I didn&rsquo;t expect you for at least another
twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was lucky enough to get hold of Major Bryan
right away,&rdquo; Mr. Parker answered, climbing over the
fence. &ldquo;Now I hope you haven&rsquo;t brought us on a wild
chase, Penny. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me and I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; she offered.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easier than explaining everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Bryan, a well-built man of early middle age,
asked Penny several questions about Professor Bettenridge
as the three walked hurriedly toward the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your description, he seems to be the man
I&rsquo;m after,&rdquo; he declared grimly. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s the same person,
his real name is Claude Arkwright and he&rsquo;s wanted
for impersonating an officer and on various other
charges. He pulled a big job in New York three
months ago, then vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Salt was waiting at the lake. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s our move?&rdquo;
he asked, after relating everything that had occurred
that night. &ldquo;Shall we cut the boat loose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, let me examine those mines,&rdquo; the major requested.
&ldquo;Can we get into the shack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can pick the lock, but it takes time,&rdquo; Salt offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll break it,&rdquo; the major decided. &ldquo;Those men
may return here at any minute, so there&rsquo;s no time to
lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was forced open and Penny was placed on
guard to watch the hillside for Webb or anyone in the
professor&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>There was no light in the shack, but both Mr. Parker
and the major had brought flashlights. Salt pointed
out the mine which had been doctored by Webb.
Carefully, the Army officer examined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell much by looking at it for the work has
been cleverly concealed,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But from
what you&rsquo;ve told me, I am quite certain how the mine
is made to explode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it done?&rdquo; Salt demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the hole is made, a chemical&mdash;probably sodium&mdash;is
inserted. Then another substance which
melts slowly in water is used to seal up the opening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that explains why Webb delayed so long in
giving the signal after the mine had been dropped into
the water!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed from the doorway. &ldquo;He
was waiting for the substance to melt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; agreed the major. &ldquo;If my theory is correct,
only the action of water is required to explode
this mine. The professor&rsquo;s machine, of course, has
nothing whatsoever to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we explode the mine now?&rdquo; Penny
suddenly proposed. &ldquo;That would put an end to the
professor&rsquo;s little scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might also prevent us from arresting him,&rdquo; the
major said. He debated a moment. Then he exclaimed:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth trying! We&rsquo;ll load the mine on
the boat and dump &rsquo;er in the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men would not permit Penny to help with the
dangerous work. Carefully they transported the mine
to the boat. Salt was about to start the motor, but the
major stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t want the sound of the engine to give
us away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll row out into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was eager to accompany the men, but they
would not hear of it. To her disappointment, she was
compelled to remain on the beach.</p>
<p>Sitting down on the sand, she nervously watched
until the boat faded into the black of the night. Presently,
she heard a splash which told her that the mine
had been lowered overboard. Anxiously, she waited
for the boat to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they come?&rdquo; she thought, straining to
hear the sound of oars. &ldquo;If the explosion should go off
while they&rsquo;re still out there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Then she heard the boat coming and breathed in relief.
Soon the craft grated on sand, and the three men
leaped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps my theory is wrong,&rdquo; the major commented,
as they all huddled together, waiting. &ldquo;The
mine should have gone off by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several minutes elapsed and still nothing happened.
And then, as the group became convinced their plan
had failed, there came a terrific explosion which sent
flame and water high above the lake&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>IN SEARCH OF WEBB</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful! Beautiful!&rdquo; chuckled the major
as the flames began to die away. &ldquo;That proves our
theory. No machine is required to set off the mines&mdash;only
the action of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Bettenridge must have heard the explosion!&rdquo;
Penny exclaimed, fairly beside herself with
excitement. &ldquo;What will happen now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If human nature runs true to form, he will soon
come here to investigate,&rdquo; the major predicted.</p>
<p>The four stepped back into the dense growth of
trees to wait. Within five minutes they observed two
shadowy figures scurrying down the path toward the
shack where the mines were stored. As they came
closer, Penny recognized the professor and his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And someone is following them,&rdquo; she discerned.
&ldquo;It looks like Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Professor Bettenridge and his wife now were near
the trees. Their voices, though low, carried to those
in hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stupid lout, Webb!&rdquo; the professor muttered.
&ldquo;He has ruined everything now by setting off the
mine too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could it have been Webb?&rdquo; his wife protested.
&ldquo;He was at the farmhouse only five minutes
ago. He wouldn&rsquo;t have had time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was someone else&mdash;&rdquo; Professor Bettenridge
paused, and cast a quick alert glance about the lake
shore. He noted that the boat was tied, but that the
door of the shack was wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been exposed!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Our game
is up, and we&rsquo;ve got to get away from here before the
authorities arrest us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about Johnson?&rdquo; his wife demanded,
glancing over her shoulder at the man who was following
them down the hillside path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do nothing now. He had begun to catch
on even before tonight, and this explosion finishes
everything. Don&rsquo;t even stop to pack your clothes.
We&rsquo;ll get our car and clear out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Webb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to look out for himself. We&rsquo;re traveling
alone and traveling fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those in hiding suddenly stepped forth from the
trees, blocking the path. Major Bryan moved directly
in front of the professor, flashing a light into his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Claude Arkwright,&rdquo; he said distinctly.</p>
<p>The professor was startled, but recovered poise
quickly. &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; he said in a cold voice.
&ldquo;My name is Bettenridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt that is what you call yourself now. You
are wanted by the Federal government for impersonating
an officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see your draft card?&rdquo; the major requested
curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I haven&rsquo;t it with me. It is in my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nettled, Professor Bettenridge could think of no
further excuse. Glancing significantly at his wife, he
said: &ldquo;My dear, will you go to the house and get the
card for our inquisitors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will all go,&rdquo; corrected the major. &ldquo;Your wife
may be wanted as your accomplice in this latest secret
ray machine fleece. We prefer that she does not
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very trusting,&rdquo; sneered the professor.</p>
<p>By this time, Mr. Johnson had reached the hillside.
Puffing from having hurried so fast, he gazed in bewilderment
at the little group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;What caused
the mine to explode?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was set off by being dropped in the lake,&rdquo; explained
the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the explosion was not touched off by
Professor Bettenridge&rsquo;s invention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The machine had nothing whatsoever to do with
it,&rdquo; Penny explained. &ldquo;Professor Bettenridge and his
accomplice, Webb Nelson, have been doctoring the
mines with a powder and an outer shield which dissolves
in water. They hoped to sell the worthless
machine to you before you discovered the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information stunned Mr. Johnson, but recovering,
he turned furiously upon Professor Bettenridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cheap trickster!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you
arrested for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you given the man any money?&rdquo; Mr. Parker
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand dollars for an option on the machine.
The rest was to have been paid tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky to get off so easily,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible too, that we can get part of your
deposit back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hold me on any trumped-up charge,&rdquo;
Professor Bettenridge said angrily. &ldquo;You have no
warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started away, but was brought up short as he felt
the major&rsquo;s revolver pressing against his ribs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This will hold you, I think,&rdquo; said the Army man
coolly. &ldquo;Now lead the way up the hill to the other
cabin. I want to see your remarkable invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his wife clinging to his arm, the professor
marched stiffly ahead of the group. He unlocked the
cabin door and all went inside.</p>
<p>Jerking off the canvas which covered the secret ray
machine, Major Bryan inspected it briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A worthless contraption!&rdquo; he said contemptuously.
&ldquo;Utterly useless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you meet Webb Nelson?&rdquo; Penny asked
the professor. &ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to find him for yourself,&rdquo; sneered the
professor. &ldquo;If he has the sense I think, he&rsquo;s probably
miles away from here by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Determined that the man should not escape, Penny,
Salt and Mr. Parker started for the farmhouse, leaving
the major and Mr. Johnson to question the professor.
As they rapped on the screen door, Mrs. Leonard
came to let them in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is going on here tonight, may I ask?&rdquo; she demanded
irritably. &ldquo;People banging in and out of the
house at all hours! Explosions! I declare, I wish I
never had rented a room to that crazy professor and
his wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Webb Nelson here?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor&rsquo;s helper? Why, no, right after the
explosion he came, gathered a bag of things from the
professor&rsquo;s room, and went off down the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was afoot when he left here. Is anything
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considerable. Professor Bettenridge has just been
exposed as an impostor. Webb must have realized the
jig was up when he heard the mine go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor an impostor!&rdquo; Mrs. Leonard exclaimed.
&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did Webb go?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the road toward town when I last saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can catch him!&rdquo; Mr. Parker cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t get a lift,&rdquo; Salt added.</p>
<p>All piled into the Parker car which had been left
a short distance down the road. But in the drive to
Newhall, the man was not sighted. Nor did inquiry
in the town reveal anyone who had seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly he expected to be followed, and cut
across the fields or took a side road,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to depend upon the authorities
to pick him up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stopping at the sheriff&rsquo;s office, warrants for the
man&rsquo;s arrest were sworn out, and the party then returned
to Mrs. Leonard&rsquo;s. Professor Bettenridge and
his wife had been brought to the farmhouse by Major
Bryan who proposed to hold them there pending the
arrival of federal authorities from Riverview.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I want to know,&rdquo; Penny whispered
to her father. &ldquo;How did Professor Bettenridge
meet Webb? Perhaps he can explain the man&rsquo;s connection
with the <i>Snark</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was put to the professor who replied
briefly that he knew nothing whatsoever about Webb
Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him only two weeks ago,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
claimed to be an expert at handling explosives, so I
hired him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one believed the professor was telling the truth.
However, it was useless to question him further. Determined
not to implicate himself, his wife, or his
helper, he spoke as seldom as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man has a room here,&rdquo; Mr. Parker suggested.
&ldquo;Suppose we see what we can find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Leonard led the way upstairs. The professor&rsquo;s
room was locked, but she opened it with a master key.</p>
<p>Two suitcases had been packed as if for a hasty departure
and everything was in disorder. All garments
had been removed from the closets. The scrap basket
was filled with torn letters which Mr. Parker promptly
gathered together and placed in an envelope for future
piecing together.</p>
<p>In one of the suitcases he found several newspaper
clippings. One bore a picture of the professor, but the
name beneath it was Claude Arkwright, and the story
related that he was wanted in connection with a $10,000
hoax.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bettenridge is our man all right,&rdquo; the publisher declared.
&ldquo;We made no mistake in holding him for the
sheriff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had been searching the larger of the two suitcases
which seemed to contain only clothing. But as
she reached the lower layer, she suddenly gave a jubilant
cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt! Dad!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here! See what
I&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>SALT&rsquo;S MISSING CAMERA</i></h2>
<p>From the suitcase, Penny lifted Salt&rsquo;s camera.
With a cry of pleasure, he snatched it from her hand
and eagerly examined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it damaged in any way?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be. So the professor had it all
the time just as we thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here are the plates I tossed into the car the
night of the explosion!&rdquo; Penny added, burrowing
deeper into the pile of clothing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably
ruined by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; said Salt, examining them. &ldquo;The professor
may have thought they were unexposed plates
and kept them for use later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it was crooked of him to try to keep
the camera,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;Though I suppose
such a small theft doesn&rsquo;t amount to much in comparison
to the trick he nearly played on Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It matters to me,&rdquo; the photographer chuckled. &ldquo;Am
I glad to get this camera back! The plates won&rsquo;t do us
any good now they are outdated, but I&rsquo;ll take them
along anyhow. I&rsquo;m curious to see if they would have
shown anything of significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means develop them,&rdquo; urged Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;Anything else in the suitcase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a pocket of the case Penny found several letters
from Mr. Johnson which she gave to her father.
Knowing they would be valuable in establishing a case
of attempted fraud against the professor, he kept them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Webb Nelson hadn&rsquo;t managed to escape,&rdquo;
Penny remarked as the trio went downstairs again.
&ldquo;He must have started for Newhall, perhaps to catch
a train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any due at this time?&rdquo; her father asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; Mr. Parker proposed. &ldquo;We can
do nothing more here. We may as well drive to the
village again and press an inquiry for Webb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the car with Salt as driver careened
over the bumpy country road to Newhall. They
reached the town without sighting anyone who resembled
the professor&rsquo;s helper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive to the station,&rdquo; Mr. Parker instructed Salt.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an outside chance Webb went there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>The depot was a drab little red building, deserted
except for a sleepy-eyed station agent who told them
there was no passenger train scheduled to leave Newhall
before six o&rsquo;clock the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any freight trains?&rdquo; Mr. Parker inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple are overdue,&rdquo; the agent said. &ldquo;No. 32
from the east, and No. 20, also westbound. No. 20&rsquo;s
just coming into the block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although it seemed unlikely Webb would take a
freight train out of town, Mr. Parker, Salt and Penny,
decided to wait for it to come in. They went outside,
standing in the shadow of the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sign of anyone around,&rdquo; Salt declared, looking
carefully about. &ldquo;We may as well go back to the
lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait,&rdquo; Penny urged.</p>
<p>No. 20 rumbled into the station, stirring up a whirlwind
of dust and cinders. A trainman with a lantern
over his arm, came into the station to get his orders
from the agent. He chatted a moment, then went out
again, swinging aboard one of the cars. A moment
later, the train began to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; Mr. Parker said impatiently.</p>
<p>Penny buttoned her coat as she stepped beyond the
protection of the building, for the night air was cold
and penetrated her thin clothing. Treading along behind
her father and Salt to the car, she started to climb
in, when her attention riveted upon a lone figure some
distance from the railroad station. A man, who resembled
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Webb Nelson in build, had emerged from behind
a tool shed, and stood close to the tracks watching
the slowly moving freight.</p>
<p>Then he ran along beside the train and suddenly
leaped into one of the empty box cars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad! Salt!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I just saw someone
leap into one of those cars! I&rsquo;m sure it was Webb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded her father. &ldquo;Which car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yellow one. Oh, he&rsquo;ll get away unless we can
have him arrested at the next town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t escape if I can stop him!&rdquo; Salt muttered.</p>
<p>Racing across the platform, he waited for the car
Penny had indicated. Although the train was moving
faster now, he leaped and swung himself to a sitting
position in the open doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out! Look out!&rdquo; Penny screamed in warning.</p>
<p>Behind Salt, the man who had taken refuge in the
car, moved stealthily toward him, obviously intending
to push him off the train. But the photographer knew
what to expect and was prepared.</p>
<p>He whirled suddenly and scrambled to his feet.
His attacker caught him slightly off balance, and they
went down together, rolling over and over on the
straw littered floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Worried for Salt, Penny and Mr. Parker ran along
beside the train. The publisher tried to leap aboard
to help the photographer, but lacking the younger
man&rsquo;s athletic prowess, he could not make it. Already
winded, he began to fall behind.</p>
<p>Penny kept on and managed to grasp the doorway
of the car, but she instantly realized she could not
swing herself through the opening. The train now
was moving rapidly and gaining speed each moment.</p>
<p>Inside the box car, the two men were rolling over
and over, each fighting desperately to gain the advantage.
Penny could not see what was happening.
Forced by the speed of the train, she let go her hold.
Her feet were swept from beneath her, and she stumbled
and fell along the right of way.</p>
<p>Before she could scramble to her feet, her father
had caught up with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s knees were skinned but the injury was so
trifling she did not speak of it. Her one concern was
for Salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad,&rdquo; she said, grasping his arm nervously.
&ldquo;What are we going to do? That brute may kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker shared Penny&rsquo;s concern, but he said
calmly: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing we can do now.
We&rsquo;ll have the station agent send a wire to the next
station. Police will meet the train and take Webb into
custody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may not be on the train by the time it reaches
the next town! Oh, Dad, Salt may be half killed before
then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father stared after the departing
freight. The engineer whistled for a high trestle
spanning a narrow river, and the train began to rumble
over it.</p>
<p>Suddenly Penny stiffened into alert attention. In
the doorway of the open boxcar, she could see the two
struggling men. Mr. Parker, too, became tense.</p>
<p>As they watched fearfully, one of the men was
pushed from the car. He rolled over and over down
a steep embankment toward the creek bed.</p>
<p>The other man, poised in the doorway an instant,
then just before the car reached the trestle, leaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>ESCAPE BY NIGHT</i></h2>
<p>Fearful for Salt, Penny and her father ran down
the tracks toward the railroad trestle. Scrambling and
sliding down the slippery embankment, they saw Salt
lying in a heap near the edge of the creek.</p>
<p>Webb, his ankle injured, was trying to hobble toward
a corn field just beyond the railroad right of
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him! Don&rsquo;t let him escape!&rdquo; Salt cried, raising
himself to his knees.</p>
<p>Although alarmed for the photographer who appeared
to have been injured by his leap, Penny and her
father pursued Webb. Handicapped as he was with
an injured ankle, they overtook him by the barbed
wire fence.</p>
<p>Already badly battered from the fight, and bruised
as a result of his fall from the train, the man put up
only a brief struggle as Mr. Parker pinned him to the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; the publisher directed Penny. &ldquo;See what
you can do for Salt. He may be badly injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer, however, had struggled to his
feet. He stood unsteadily, staring down at his torn
clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Penny asked anxiously, running
to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; he said, gingerly touching a
bruised jaw. &ldquo;Boy! Is that lad a scrapper? Did you
see me push him out of the boxcar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly did, and we were frightened half to
death! We thought you would be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hobbling over to the fence, Salt confronted his
assailant. Webb&rsquo;s face was a sorry sight. His nose
was crimson, both eyes were blackened and his lip was
bleeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well come along without making any
more trouble,&rdquo; Mr. Parker told him grimly. &ldquo;Professor
Bettenridge has been taken into custody, and
the entire fraud has been exposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured that out when I heard the mine go off,&rdquo;
the man returned sullenly. &ldquo;Okay, you got me, but
I was only carrying out orders. I worked for Professor
Bettenridge, but any deals he made were his
business, not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; replied Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you talk to the sheriff. Move along, and
no monkey business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Having no weapon, Salt and the publisher walked
on either side of the prisoner, while Penny brought
up the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to hang onto me,&rdquo; he complained
bitterly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to try to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sure you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Salt, &ldquo;because
we&rsquo;ll be watching you every step of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, as the four tramped down the tracks toward
the station, the prisoner showed no disposition
to talk. But gradually his curiosity gained the better
of him. He sought information about Professor Bettenridge&rsquo;s
arrest, and then tried to build up a story
that would convince his captors he had only been an
employee hired on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know nothing about the <i>Snark</i>
either,&rdquo; Penny observed bitterly. &ldquo;After Ben Bartell
and I pulled you out of the river, you repaid us by
stealing his watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her astonishment, the man reached in his pocket
and gave her the timepiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said gruffly, &ldquo;give it back to him. I
won&rsquo;t need it where I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you take the watch when it didn&rsquo;t belong
to you?&rdquo; Penny pursued the subject. &ldquo;Especially
after Ben risked his life to pull you out of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the man answered impatiently.
&ldquo;I needed a watch, so I took it. Quit askin&rsquo; so many
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you pushed off the <i>Snark</i>?&rdquo; Penny demanded,
refusing to abandon the subject.</p>
<p>She did not expect Webb to answer the question as
he had refused to explain at the time of his rescue. To
her surprise, he replied grimly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tried to get rid of me. We had a disagreement
over a job they wanted me to pull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What job was that?&rdquo; Mr. Parker interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamiting the Conway Steel Plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words produced a powerful effect upon the
publisher, Salt, and Penny. At their stunned silence,
Webb added hastily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand, I didn&rsquo;t do it. They got sore
because I refused to pull the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; Penny protested.
&ldquo;Evidently, you are mixed up on your dates, because
the Conway Plant explosion took place before the
night we rescued you from the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know,&rdquo; the man muttered, trying to cover
his slip of tongue. &ldquo;They were afraid I&rsquo;d squawk to
the police and that was why they pitched me overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who pulled the job?&rdquo; Salt asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Someone was hired to set off the
explosion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Webb&rsquo;s story was accepted but not believed.
Penny knew from previous experience that the man
was more inclined to tell a lie than the truth. Convinced
that he might have been implicated in the explosion,
she suddenly recalled his visit to the office of
Jason Cordell. Could his call there have any hidden
significance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a friend of Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
inquired abruptly.</p>
<p>The question caught Webb off guard. He gave her
a quick look but answered in an indifferent way:
&ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain I saw you in his office,&rdquo; Penny insisted.</p>
<p>Realizing that his loose talk was building up trouble
for himself, Webb would say no more. At the sheriff&rsquo;s
office, he repeated practically the same story, insisting
that he had been hired by Professor Bettenridge
on a wage basis, and that he was in no way implicated
in the plot to defraud Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your story doesn&rsquo;t hang together,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
said severely. &ldquo;Naturally you knew that the professor&rsquo;s
machine was worthless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at first,&rdquo; Webb whined. &ldquo;He only told me
he wanted a mine exploded at a certain time. It was
only by chance that I learned he intended to cheat
Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering the conversations I overheard between
you and the professor, that is a little hard to
believe,&rdquo; Penny contributed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might go a little easier with you, if you come
through with the truth,&rdquo; a deputy sheriff in charge of
the office, added. &ldquo;Anything you want to say before
we lock you up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Webb hesitated a long while, and then in a subdued
voice said: &ldquo;Okay, I may as well tell you. Sure,
I knew the professor and his wife were crooks. They
offered me a split on the profits if Johnson bought
the secret ray machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you obtain your mines?&rdquo; Salt asked
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Webb answered, and for once
spoke the truth. &ldquo;Professor Bettenridge had a friend
hooked up in a munitions plant who supplied him with
a few which were defective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell us the truth about the <i>Snark</i>,&rdquo; Penny
insisted. &ldquo;You said those men were mixed up in the
dynamiting of the Conway Steel Plant. Was that one
of the professor&rsquo;s jobs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His car was in the vicinity of the plant on the
night of the explosion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just accident then,&rdquo; Webb maintained. &ldquo;He
had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do know the persons involved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I told you, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo; Webb
said sullenly. &ldquo;Why not go to the <i>Snark</i> and get information
first hand if you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>It was evident the man would reveal no more, so
the deputy sheriff locked him up. Within a few
minutes Professor Bettenridge and his wife were
brought in, and although they indignantly demanded
release, they too were placed in jail cells.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson who had accompanied Major Bryan to
the sheriff&rsquo;s office, seemed rather stunned by the events
which had transpired. He shook Penny&rsquo;s hand and
could not praise her enough for exposing the professor&rsquo;s
trickery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I was,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;His
smooth talk hypnotized me. Why, I might have paid
a large sum of money to him, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you.
Now I shall prosecute charges vigorously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wealthy man tried to press money upon both
Penny and Salt, who smilingly refused to accept it.
They assured him that knowing the professor&rsquo;s trick
had failed was ample reward.</p>
<p>By the time Penny, her father and Salt finally
reached the Parker home it was nearly midnight.
Somewhat to their surprise, Mrs. Weems was still
waiting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came!&rdquo; she exclaimed, before they
could explain what had happened. &ldquo;Nearly an hour
ago someone telephoned, asking for Penny. I think
the message may be important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man named Edward McClusky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river diver!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;What did
he want, Mrs. Weems?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At first he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me, saying he had to talk
to you personally. However, I finally persuaded him
to trust me with the message. He said: &lsquo;Tell Miss
Parker that her friend Ben Bartell went aboard the
<i>Snark</i> last night and hasn&rsquo;t been seen since.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>A RAID ON THE</i> SNARK</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why didn&rsquo;t Mr. McClusky call the police instead?&rdquo;
Penny cried anxiously. &ldquo;Ben may be in serious
trouble!&rdquo; Turning to her father she added: &ldquo;Dad,
we must go there right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the <i>Snark</i>?&rdquo; Mr. Parker frowned and reached
for the telephone. &ldquo;The matter is one for the police,
Penny. I&rsquo;ll call the night inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contacting the police station, the publisher explained
why he believed it advisable to search the
<i>Snark</i>. He was assured that a squad would be sent
there at once to investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had other complaints about that vessel,&rdquo; the
inspector said. &ldquo;So far we&rsquo;ve not been able to find
anything out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having notified the police, Mr. Parker felt that his
duty was done, but not Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, can&rsquo;t we go there too?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Ben
is in trouble and we may be able to help him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what we could do, Penny. Besides, you
know how I feel about Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re dead wrong. You&rsquo;ve done him a
dreadful injustice. Tonight may prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker wavered, then suddenly gave in. &ldquo;All
right, get your heavy coat,&rdquo; he instructed. &ldquo;It will
be cold along the waterfront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny raced for the warm garment and joined her
father and Salt as they were backing the press car out
of the driveway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Snark</i> is tied up at Pier 23,&rdquo; Penny directed.
&ldquo;Straight down this street and turn at Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car reached the docks, parking alongside a dark
warehouse. There was no sign of the police. A short
distance away, the <i>Snark</i> with only dim deck lights
showing, and no one in view, tugged at her heavy
ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait for the police,&rdquo; Mr. Parker decided.</p>
<p>Within five minutes, two cars glided noiselessly up
to the pier and a dozen men in uniform leaped out.
Captain Bricker, in charge of the squad, strode to the
<i>Snark</i> and called loudly: &ldquo;Ahoy, there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, the <i>Snark</i>!&rdquo; he shouted again.</p>
<p>Still receiving no answer, he ordered his men aboard.
Single file, they crawled cautiously up a ladder to the
dark deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone aboard?&rdquo; the captain called once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Salt, Mr. Parker and Penny, eager for first hand information,
followed the policemen up the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My men will search the vessel,&rdquo; Captain Bricker
told them, &ldquo;but no one appears to be aboard. Everything
seems in order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spreading out over the ship, the policemen returned
one by one to report they could find nothing amiss.
Not even a watchman was aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be a wild-goose chase, Captain,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker apologized. &ldquo;Sorry to have bothered you.
We considered our information reliable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policemen began to leave. Penny, lingering
on deck until the last, was being helped onto the ladder
by Captain Bricker, when they both heard a sound
below decks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; the officer muttered, listening
alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded like someone thumping on a wall,&rdquo;
Penny cried. &ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The noise was not repeated a third time, but Captain
Bricker had heard enough to make him believe
that someone remained below. Drawing his revolver,
and warning Penny to keep back, he started down the
dark companionway.</p>
<p>At a safe distance, Penny trailed him. His bright
flashlight beam cut paths of light over the walls as he
tried the doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone here?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>A thumping noise came from a room on the right.
Guided by the sound, Captain Bricker tried the door.
It was locked.</p>
<p>A powerfully built man, the officer hurled his
weight against the door, and the lock gave way.
Keeping back, lest he become a target for a bullet, he
kicked the door open. The room was empty! But,
the flashlight beam caught the outline of a trapdoor
in the floor. The officer flung it open. Below, in the
hold, lay a man gagged and bound hand and foot.</p>
<p>Following the police officer into the room,
<a href="#front">Penny uttered a little cry</a>
as she recognized Ben Bartell.
Blinking owlishly in the light which had been focused
upon him, he was a deplorable sight. His face was
bruised, his hair matted with blood, and one eye was
swollen almost shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ben! What have they done to you?&rdquo; Penny
gasped in horror.</p>
<p>Captain Bricker cut the young man free, and pulled
the gag from his mouth. He helped Ben into a chair
and then went to another cabin for water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did this to you?&rdquo; Penny asked, rubbing the
reporter&rsquo;s hands to restore circulation.</p>
<p>He seemed too exhausted to reply so she did not
urge him to speak. The captain brought water which
Ben drank thirstily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s evidently been tied up several hours,&rdquo; the
officer commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since last night,&rdquo; Ben whispered, moistening his
cracked lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sneaked on when no one was looking&mdash;wanted
to see what I could learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were the men that tied you up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. But before they caught me, I heard
plenty. The men on this boat are mixed up in the
dynamiting of the Conway Steel Plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded, for this information correlated with
what she already had learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Webb Nelson involved in the plot?&rdquo; she
asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He set off the dynamite according to what I overheard
last night,&rdquo; Ben revealed. &ldquo;But he got into a
fight with the gang over his pay for the job. He tried
to shake them down for a big sum, threatening to spill
everything to the police if they didn&rsquo;t cough up. It
ended up in a fight, and Webb was pushed overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we pulled him out of the river,&rdquo; Penny supplied.
&ldquo;But he refused to tell us a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew better than to spill the story because
he would have implicated himself. And the gang
aboard this boat had no fear either, because they figured
he was only pulling a bluff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But who was behind the plot?&rdquo; Penny asked, puzzled.
&ldquo;What did the men hope to gain by dynamiting
the plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did it on orders from a man higher up&mdash;a
man who personally hates the owner of the Conway
Steel Plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was a grudge matter?&rdquo; Captain Bricker
inquired dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely,&rdquo; Ben returned. &ldquo;Labor troubles are
mixed up in it. This man, who represents a minor faction,
has been trying to gain control over the employes
without much success. By planning a series of accidents
similar to the dynamiting, he thought he might
bring the management around to his way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the leader?&rdquo; Penny demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>Ben hesitated. &ldquo;I hate to say,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;because
I&rsquo;m not absolutely certain. In the conversation
I overheard before I was caught, he wasn&rsquo;t mentioned
by name. But by putting two and two together, I
have a fairly good idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guessing won&rsquo;t do in this business,&rdquo; said Captain
Bricker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; admitted Ben. &ldquo;But here is one bit
of fact I gained. The big boss was at the factory on
the night of the explosion. In fact, he was nearly
caught, and a photographer snapped a picture of him
as he fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of that?&rdquo; Penny demanded excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard the men talking about it. The boss
has been worried for fear that picture will show up
and convict him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m beginning to understand,&rdquo; Penny murmured.
&ldquo;It explains why the <i>Star</i> photography room
was broken into several times. Someone was after
those plates which weren&rsquo;t there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the pictures?&rdquo; Captain Bricker
asked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll prove valuable evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Salt Sommers has the camera and plates in
the press car. Of course, we don&rsquo;t know what the
plates will show until they&rsquo;re developed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have them at once,&rdquo; the captain said.
He turned again to Ben. &ldquo;Now did you know any
of the men who attacked you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a one. But I can give you a fairly good description
of most of them. They&rsquo;re waterfront riff-raff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case some of them may have their pictures
in our files,&rdquo; the captain said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll issue orders to
round up all loiterers in this neighborhood. You
should be able to identify most of them in a police
line-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now about the higher-up, who engineered the
scheme. You said you had an idea who he is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Ben. &ldquo;The men spoke of
him as a publisher. I don&rsquo;t like to accuse him outright,
because I&rsquo;ll be suspected of trying to get even
with a man I hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Light came swiftly to Penny. Into her mind leaped
many facts hitherto puzzling, but which now seemed
suddenly clear. The open skylight&mdash;the building adjoining
the <i>Star</i>&mdash;Webb Nelson&rsquo;s call upon the editor
of the <i>Mirror</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, you don&rsquo;t need to accuse anyone!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it myself. The man is Jason Cordell, and I
think we can prove it too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>PICTURE PROOF</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jason Cordell is the man responsible,&rdquo;
Ben agreed soberly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t prove it, but in my own
mind I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used to work for him, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the police
captain inquired, the inflection of his voice implying
that he thought the former reporter might be prejudiced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was fired,&rdquo; Ben admitted readily. &ldquo;Cordell let
me go and blacklisted me everywhere to prevent me
from exposing him. He wanted to discredit me, so
that anything I might say would carry no weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you really discharged, Ben?&rdquo; Penny
asked. &ldquo;What did you learn about Mr. Cordell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he had pulled off no end of crooked deals
and that he was mixed up with this outlaw labor
group. Over a period of three or four years, Cordell
has made a mint of money, and not from his paper
either!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll question Cordell tonight,&rdquo; Captain Bricker
promised. &ldquo;The trick now is to get you to the station
for first aid treatment. Then we&rsquo;ll want you to look
through the police morgue and identify the pictures
of as many of the <i>Snark&rsquo;s</i> crew as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer turned to Penny. &ldquo;As for those undeveloped
plates, can you get them right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Penny returned. While Captain
Bricker helped Ben up the companionway, she ran
ahead to find her father and Salt and tell them of the
latest developments.</p>
<p>The two were waiting in the press car. But when
Mr. Parker learned how significant the pictures of
the Conway Plant explosion might prove to be, he
surprised Penny by declining to turn them over immediately
to the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may want those plates for the <i>Star</i>,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;If the police once get their hands on them,
it might be a job to get them back again in time to be
of any use to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jason Cordell&rsquo;s arrest may depend upon them,&rdquo;
Penny protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the plates developed, and let police see
them,&rdquo; Mr. Parker decided. &ldquo;But the plates must
remain in our hands. Come on, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a nod from the publisher, Salt started the press
car, and without being instructed, headed for the <i>Star</i>
building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take you to develop those plates?&rdquo;
Mr. Parker asked the photographer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; approved the publisher. &ldquo;If they reveal
anything, we&rsquo;ll telephone the police station at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the car coasted to a standstill alongside the <i>Star</i>
building, Penny&rsquo;s gaze roved to the darkened offices
next door. All of the floors save one were without
light. But in the suite occupied by the <i>Mirror</i>, a man
plainly could be seen moving to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Jason Cordell now!&rdquo; she drew attention
to him. &ldquo;Why do you suppose he&rsquo;s at his office so
late tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no crime in that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;He may be guilty as Ben says, but I&rsquo;ll not believe it
until I have the proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letting themselves into the newspaper building, the
three went up the back stairs to the photography
studio. Salt immediately set about developing the
plates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is coming up all right!&rdquo; he declared
jubilantly, as he rocked the developer tray back and
forth.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, Salt had washed the plates and
was able to examine them beneath the red light. One
was blurred and revealed little. But the other plainly
showed a man fleeing toward a waiting car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the man is Webb Nelson!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed,
recognizing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But notice the driver of the car,&rdquo; Salt said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Jason Cordell! Ben was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the man is guilty!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;Oh, Dad,
I was certain of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker scanned the plate carefully to ascertain
there was no possible mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Jason Cordell,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;The truth
is hard to believe. Why, I lunched with him only
yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, he&rsquo;s a criminal no matter how respectable he
has acted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; acknowledged Mr. Parker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
notify the police at once and have him picked up for
questioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Transmitting the important information to police
headquarters, Mr. Parker talked with Captain Bricker
who promised to take personal charge of the matter.
As the publisher hung up the receiver, he was startled
to have Penny grasp his arm. Excitedly, she pointed
out the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; he asked, failing to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light just went off in Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s office!
He&rsquo;s leaving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll stop him,&rdquo; her father decided. &ldquo;Salt,
you stay here and rush that plate through! I&rsquo;ll detain
Cordell by one means or another until the police arrive!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>With Penny close beside him, he ran down the back
stairs to the street. Breathlessly they arrived at the
next building. The elevator was not running, but
they could hear someone coming down the stairway.
Then Jason Cordell, a brief case tucked under his arm,
came into view. He stopped short upon seeing Mr.
Parker and his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working late?&rdquo; Mr. Parker inquired pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed the other. He would have
walked on, but the publisher barred the exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I met a friend of yours tonight,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker said, stalling for time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so? Who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Webb Nelson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s face did not change expression, but
his eyes narrowed guardedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a friend of mine,&rdquo; he corrected carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen him in your office,&rdquo; Penny said.</p>
<p>Mr. Cordell looked her straight in the eyes and
smiled as if in amusement. &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; he admitted,
&ldquo;but all who come to my office are not my
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to pass again, but Mr. Parker stood his
ground. &ldquo;Say, what is this?&rdquo; Mr. Cordell demanded,
suddenly suspicious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to ask you a few questions about
your friend Webb Nelson. Suppose we go back to
your office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cordell retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired
and I&rsquo;m going home. If you want to see me, come
around tomorrow during business hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which may be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; the <i>Mirror</i>
editor blustered. &ldquo;Furthermore, I&rsquo;m not interested.
Get out of my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Parker grasped him firmly by the arm.
Cordell tried to jerk free, and in so doing, dropped his
brief case, which Penny promptly seized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give that to me!&rdquo; the man shouted furiously.</p>
<p>Penny smiled, for through the plate glass window
she had observed the approach of a police car. Another
moment and uniformed men were swarming
about Mr. Cordell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; the man demanded
angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll report you all to the Safety Director
who is my friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll report to him all right,&rdquo; agreed Captain
Bricker. &ldquo;Now come along quietly. If you can answer
a few questions satisfactorily, you&rsquo;ll be allowed
to return home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo; Cordell asked sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you on the night of the 16th?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now how should I know?&rdquo; the man retorted
sarcastically. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember that far back. But
probably I was home in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted in connection with the Conway
dynamiting,&rdquo; the officer informed him.</p>
<p>Mr. Cordell snorted with anger. &ldquo;Of all the ridiculous
charges! I know nothing about the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of the door burst Salt Sommers. He was
without a hat, but he carried a picture, still wet, in
the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know nothing about the dynamiting,&rdquo; he
mimicked. &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, take a look at this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cordell and the policemen gathered about him,
studying the photograph. Plainly it showed Webb
Nelson fleeing toward a car driven by the <i>Mirror</i>
editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this prove?&rdquo; the man blustered. &ldquo;I
admit the car is mine. I was driving past the plant at
the time of the explosion. This fellow, Nelson, leaped
into my auto and ordered me to drive on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A moment ago you claimed you weren&rsquo;t even
near the Conway Plant,&rdquo; Penny tripped him. &ldquo;You
knew Webb Nelson very well. Furthermore, you
entered the <i>Star</i> offices several times trying to get your
hands on this picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least once when you found the stairway door
locked, you went in through the skylight,&rdquo; Penny
accused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the crazy ideas!&rdquo; The editor laughed jeeringly.
&ldquo;Imagine me crawling through a skylight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice your coat has a torn place,&rdquo; Penny said,
taking a scrap of blue wool from her purse. &ldquo;This, I
believe, is a perfect match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cordell gazed at the wool and shrugged. &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; he admitted coolly. &ldquo;I did crawl through the
skylight twice to see if I could find the picture. I
knew this fool photographer had snapped a picture
of me, and I feared I might be falsely accused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you knew Nelson was mixed up in the dynamiting?&rdquo;
Captain Bricker questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t certain,&rdquo; Mr. Cordell said in confusion.
&ldquo;The reason I didn&rsquo;t report to the police was that I
was afraid of being involved. After that night, Webb
Nelson tried to blackmail me. Because of my position,
I dared have no publicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Mirror</i> editor&rsquo;s explanation carried a certain
amount of conviction, and Penny was dismayed to
hear Captain Bricker assure him that if a mistake had
been made he would be granted freedom immediately
after he had talked to the police chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall accompany you without protest,&rdquo; the <i>Mirror</i>
editor returned stiffly. &ldquo;Later I shall file charges
against those who have tried to damage my character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Bricker asked Salt for the picture which he
intended to take to police headquarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see it a moment?&rdquo; Penny requested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>He gave the picture to her. She studied it and her
face brightened. &ldquo;Captain Bricker, look at this!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, pointing to an object in the car which
barely was noticeable.</p>
<p>Everyone gathered about Penny, peering at the
photograph. On the rear seat of the car driven by
Mr. Cordell was a box which plainly bore the printing:
&ldquo;Salvage Company&mdash;Explosives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed McClusky who works for the Salvage Company,
told me that dynamite had been stolen from his
firm,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;And here it is in Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s
automobile! Apparently, he wasn&rsquo;t just driving
by the plant at the time of the explosion! This picture
proves why he was there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, young lady,&rdquo; chuckled Captain
Bricker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve pinned the goods on him for fair.&rdquo;
Prodding the <i>Mirror</i> editor with his stick, he ordered
curtly: &ldquo;Get along, you! This puts a different face
on it. You&rsquo;ll be spending the rest of the night in the
Safety building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Mr. Cordell, still protesting his innocence,
had been taken away, Penny, her father, and Salt returned
to the deserted newspaper building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Cordell manage to get free?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance of it,&rdquo; Mr. Parker answered. &ldquo;That
picture tags him right. With Ed McClusky and Ben
to testify against him, he&rsquo;s the same as convicted now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Ben, what&rsquo;s to be done about him,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him a job here. He&rsquo;s had unfair treatment,
but we&rsquo;ll make it up to him. However, we&rsquo;ll
have to let one employee go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me?&rdquo; Penny asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; her father laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your friend, Elda
Hunt. Her attitude isn&rsquo;t right. We&rsquo;ve tried to give
her a chance, but over and over she has demonstrated
that she isn&rsquo;t cut out to be a newspaper woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll probably blame me for her discharge,&rdquo;
Penny sighed. &ldquo;Not that it matters. I ceased worrying
about Elda a long while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have no difficulty getting work elsewhere,
and I hope she&rsquo;ll be better adjusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the story of Mr. Cordell&rsquo;s arrest? And
the picture?&rdquo; Penny inquired. &ldquo;Will the <i>Star</i> print
them tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the front page of our first edition,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
chuckled. &ldquo;Salt didn&rsquo;t turn over the plate to the
police, so we&rsquo;re all set. By morning, the story should
be bigger and better than ever. By then, the guilt will
be well pinned on Cordell, and some of the <i>Snark</i>
gang may have been rounded up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Curious to learn the very latest details, Salt called
the police station. He was told that Ben Bartell had
identified several of the <i>Snark&rsquo;s</i> crew from police pictures,
and it was expected all would be arrested within
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad night&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; Mr. Parker chuckled, as
he snapped off the photography room lights. &ldquo;Everything
locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the skylight?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open again,&rdquo; reported Salt as he checked it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just no use trying to get folks to cooperate around
here. Too many fresh air fiends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it stay unlocked,&rdquo; Mr. Parker directed carelessly.
&ldquo;With our prowler safely behind bars, we&rsquo;ve
no further cause for worry.&rdquo; He looked at his watch.
&ldquo;Now, even though it is late, suppose we go and celebrate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fine!&rdquo; cried Penny. &ldquo;And why not stop at
the Safety building and ask Ben Bartell to go with us?
I want to tell him about his new job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed her father heartily. &ldquo;Where
shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny linked arms with Salt and her father, skipping
as she piloted them down the dark hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a quiet place where they serve big juicy
steaks,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;If I know Ben, that&rsquo;s what he
would like best of all.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Transcriber&rsquo;s Notes</h2>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
